I go back-and-forth on whether the Wyoming or Utah slam is easier to complete, but I am absolutely certain about which one is the most difficult. Nevada has it all--long driving distances, small, brushy creeks, difficult to find and catch fish, and unlike Utah and Wyoming which require catching four fish, Nevada has six(!) in its slam. I have not completed the Nevada slam, and according to their angler recognition program, fewer than 30 people have ever completed it. I have caught three of the six, and it is just very, very difficult.

Nevad also refers to their contest as a "fish slam" rather than a "cutt slam" because two of the fish are not cutthroat trout.
