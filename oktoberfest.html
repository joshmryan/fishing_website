<p>I went to Munich for Oktoberfest in 2022, the first year the event was held since the pandemic. A number of my friends had been and encouraged me to go, with one of them saying something like, “it’s the most fun I’ve ever had.” My overall verdict is not quite as enthusiastic. I thought it was mostly fun, though it wasn’t the life-changing experience I was hoping it would be.</p>
<p>A number of things worked against me. First, I got sick three days into a five day trip. I don’t think it was COVID as I took a few tests which were all negative, but one of my friends tested positive when he arrived back in the states. I will say that if you are at all concerned about getting COVID, Oktoberfest is not the place for you. The tents are fully enclosed with tens of thousands of people drinking, singing, and yelling, and the bathrooms are crowded and not well ventilated. I was told after leaving that the “Wiesen-flu” is a common sickness around Germany after Oktoberfest ends. I’m guessing that’s what I got, and though I felt better enough to leave my AirBnB after about a day and a half of sickness, it took me weeks to shake the congestion.</p>
<p>Besides being stuck in a hotel room for about a day and half during my trip, it was rainy and cold the entire time. This means the outdoor beer gardens at both the tents and within the city were all closed. This also probably made things more crowded inside and at times, it was difficult to find room in the tents (more on that below). Finally, our AirBnB was not nice, which is a thing that happens sometimes and there isn’t much to do about it. Rates in hotels and AirBnBs for Oktoberfest are pricey, and we tried to squeeze five or six people into three bedrooms, with limited success.</p>
<section id="travel-to-and-around-munich" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="travel-to-and-around-munich">Travel to and Around Munich</h3>
<p>It’s easy enough to fly from the states to Munich, and once one arrives, there is a train that goes straight into the city after about a half hour ride. I suppose one could take an Uber or taxi, but there’s almost no reason to do that as the train is cheap and straightforward. Make sure you buy a ticket though because the police checked on the train I was on and wrote two women a ticket.</p>
<p>Once in Munich, there is a bus and streetcar system that is kind of navigable to non-German speakers. It took us a few attempts to figure out how to buy tickets as there weren’t any machines at most of the streetcar stations, but you can buy them from the drivers. This requires having the right Euro denominations, however.</p>
<p>I mostly used the city bike and scooter shares, and walked. Annoyingly, the bike share requires an app that is easiest to setup before you leave and can be found <a href="https://www.callabike.de/en/munich/">here</a>. Another word of caution. My friend and I tried to use scooters after leaving Oktoberfest one night when the police approached us and warned us that we weren’t allowed to bike or scooter after drinking. They were exceedingly nice about it, but told us that doing so is the equivalent of driving a car drunk (which is, of course, complete absurd). Another night I rode a bike home and no one stopped me, but apparently that was risky.</p>
</section>
<section id="oktoberfest-grounds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oktoberfest-grounds">Oktoberfest Grounds</h3>
<p>Within the Oktoberfest grounds, there are rides, food, tents, and gift shops. The food, both at the stands and in the tents, was shockingly good. The tents are mostly chicken and sausage, priced at roughly what they would be in the states. Outside at the stands, there was a greater variety and was perhaps a bit cheaper than in the tents. The rides are carnival rides basically, and I wasn’t interested because of how cold and rainy it was.</p>
<p>The tents and grounds are more crowded at night, obviously, but surprisingly, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. We saw only one fight our entire Oktoberfest trip, not involving Americans, thank god.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-tents" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-tents">The Tents</h3>
<p>There are something like twelve different main tents, and I probably walked through about eight of them. The vibe inside each of them was shockingly different–one tent seemed to have more Germans, while another tent seemed to have no one over the age of about 20 in it. They all have different looks and decorations, though all of them have a band and band leaders and they all seemed to basically play the same songs. It was a mix of pop singalong favorites (think Abba, YMCA, Take Me Home Country Roads, Sweet Caroline) and German songs, especially the “Ziggy Zaggy, Ziggy Zaggy, Oi Oi” song. For some reason, “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus, which I hadn’t heard in 15 years, is really popular. The music, especially the pop music, gets kind of old after awhile as it seems pitched at the Boomer/Gen-X karoake demographic. The beer mostly tastes the same though I had a weak preference for some of the beers over others.</p>
<p>How wild were things inside the tents? It kind of depended on the tent, but moderately wild, especially at night. After about 7 p.m. everyone has had a lot to drink so most people are just drinking and talking. As alluded to above, everyone is pretty well behaved and security is present but not exactly like at an American club. I saw one person throwing up everywhere and security eventually saw him and gently escorted him out. I saw a handful of people doing drugs and they weren’t exactly being that surreptitious about it. I didn’t see any fights except the one I mentioned outside a tent. In some of the tents, people stand on the benches rather than sit at the table, but occassionally a bench goes over and people go everywhere.</p>
</section>
<section id="do-you-need-reservations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-you-need-reservations">Do You Need Reservations?</h3>
<p>Yes, it would be helpful, but reservations are not strictly necessary and it isn’t that easy for non-Germans to make reservations. It seems to depend on the tent, the day, and the time. Our experience was that reservations were not needed anywhere during the day as things were pretty open, especially on Thursday and Friday. At night, things were more crowded, and reservations were required in some of the tents we visited. In others, the servers were willing to squeeze you in if there was room at a table, though in most of the tents you could also squeeze into the walkways, though this is a bit claustrophobic and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Our experience was as follows. The first tent we went to was on Thursday afternoon and it wasn’t very crowded. We were able to sit down and we ordered food and beers. At about 4 p.m., the server kicked us out of our table so they could begin preparing for the evening shift, for which all tables were reserved.</p>
<p>After that, we walked into another tent, couldn’t find any space, walked into a third tent, and decided we needed to be more aggressive about making space. My group split up, and myself and two of my friends were able to make space in a walkway rather than at a table. This made it a little tricky to get beer, though with a little persistence we were able to. I think the key thing for Americans to remember is that personal space and beer service are not as regimented as in the U.S. If you see a plausible place to stand, occupy that space until someone makes you move. If you see a server walking by with beer, wave them down. It’s a little bit more of a free-for-all as compared to American restaurants or bars.</p>
<p>The next night, Friday night, was much more crowded, but we were able to get a table in a tent in the early afternoon. This particular tent did not make us leave and we held that table until closing (which is early, about 10 p.m.) The server did try to squeeze other people in at our table, and if your party wasn’t large enough, other people were going to be put at your table.</p>
<p>The reality is, even if you want to make a reservation it’s likely not going to be possible. Figuring out the websites prior to leaving the States seemed almost impossible. Those sites that I could figure out required significant deposits for both beer and food (something like $150 a person, with a minimum on the number of people) that I wasn’t willing to shell out before getting to Germany.</p>
<p>In sum, though I think reservations would have helped, especially the first night, it wasn’t easy to make them and we were able to survive without them. It’s important to get to a tent before things get crowded in the early evening. If you get kicked out of your table at 4 p.m., move quickly to another tent to get a table for the evening. If you’ve got a table at around 5, don’t leave it unless you’re ready to go home.</p>
</section>
<section id="would-i-go-back" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="would-i-go-back">Would I Go Back?</h3>
<p>I’ve thought about this question a lot, and I think the answer is yes, especially if I knew other people who were going. In retrospect, I had a lot of bad luck that diminished my fun. Getting sick halfway through the trip meant I didn’t actually get all that much time at Oktoberfest. The weather definitely didn’t help things either.</p>
<p>If you can’t go during Oktoberfest, one could have a similar experience just by going to the beer halls in downtown Munich. In fact, we did that the first night and it may have been my favorite overall experience. Many of the breweries have their own halls near Marienplatz and it’s easy to walk between them. The beer is the same, the food is probably better, and there are Bavarian bands and lots of other people hanging out.</p>
<p>One final thing: wear lederhosen or a dirndl at Oktoberfest. Almost everyone wears it, and it makes the experience more fun and festive. I read some stuff online that said not to buy cheap or knock-off clothes because the Germans will be annoyed, but I really doubt anyone would notice. I bought some lederhosen but my friends rented from this <a href="https://bavarian-outfitters.de/en/">place</a>, which was a good option.</p>
