    "section": "",
    "text": "Bear River Cutthroat–Cache Valley\nIn Cache Valley, there are a number of options for catching the Bear River cutthroat as all local waters contain them. The Logan River is the largest river, and most obvious. It’s a classic western free-stone trout stream, fishable from about early July through early November. In most places, the Logan is no more than knee deep, though there are some larger holes.\nBrown trout, and even some brook and rainbow trout also exist in the Logan, but the higher one goes in the canyon, the more likely it is one will catch a cutt. I mentally divide the river into lower, middle, and upper sections. I think of the lower section as from the mouth of the canyon where a small lake exists (locally referred to as “first dam”), to about Card Canyon, where there is a picnic area and turnout on the highway. From there, the middle section flows close to the road in most places in a tight canyon until the road climbs high above the river, referred to as the “dugway.” I’d never heard that term until I moved to Utah, and I’m still not sure what it means, but the road cuts across the face of a mountain and climbs until it once again meets the river. Temple Fork flows into the Logan shortly after the dugway. The upper part of the Logan is my favorite area to fish as the river is usually a little farther away from the road, and the fishing and scenery are good. However, this area probably receives the most pressure, though pressure on the Logan is light compared to most well-known western trout streams.\nI almost always fish above about Card Canyon (haven’t had much success lower), and the middle canyon section is mostly brown trout. My experience has been that after the dugway, in the upper section, there are more cutts than browns. The fishing is generally good on drys, especially in mid to late summer. Current regulations prohibit fishing from Red Banks Campground upstream to Idaho until the second weekend in July, though in a good water year the river will be still be blown out by then.\nNear the top of the canyon, the Logan River leaves the highway and flows almost due north-south from its headwaters in Idaho. This area is referred to as Franklin Basin, and there is a good forest road that parallels the river in this area with lots of dispersed camping, though it can get crowded. Beaver Creek flows into the Logan from the northeast at the start of Franklin Basin (moving upstream) and the highway flows alongside of it after leaving the Logan.\n Franklin Basin in the fall.\nThe Logan in Franklin Basin, Beaver Creek, and the Temple Fork are almost excluisvely cutts and have good fishing. I’ve had a lot of success in Franklin Basin, and in Spawn Creek, which meets Temple Fork a mile upstream of Temple Fork’s confluence with the Logan. A short hike up Spawn Creek offers nice beaver ponds, but I sometimes find the fish here can be surprisingly picky. I’ve never seen anyone else fishing Spawn Creek. I’ve had less success in Temple Fork, though I have caught fish in it. A lot of it is pretty brushy, and the more open parts don’t seem to hold a lot of fish, so I generally prefer Spawn Creek. Franklin Basin is also brushy in parts, especially farther upstream, but there are a lot of fish in there.\n Beaver ponds on Spawn Creek.\nLower down, Right Hand Fork flows into the Logan from the right hand side of the highway (moving upstream), and is all cutthroats. There is a good forest service road up some of Right Hand Fork, and a campground near the junction of two forest roads. There is also a trail that continues up Right Hand Fork after the road ends, following the creek for about 1.5 to 2 miles. Right Hand Fork seems to be a popular place to catch cutts. There are a few promotional videos online of media personalities and DWR employees talking about the slam and where to catch Bear River cutts, and it often looks like they are in Right Hand Fork.\nThe creek is separated from the mainstem Logan by a weir built a few years ago to protect it from encroaching browns. Right Hand Fork was then treated in 2013 to kill the browns and replanted with cutts sometime after. When I started fishing it in 2016, it was full of cutts and once I figured out how to deal with the brush, there were days when I caught dozens of fish. Since then, the fish seem to have become a little bit smarter so the fishing does not seem quite as good as it did in 2016 or 2017, although fish densities are very high. The other problem with Right Hand Fork is that is a very small and brushy stream for much of its course near the road and trail, so it can be difficult to find a spot to cast. Rattlesnakes and moose are hazards.\n Right Hand Fork in the fall.\nHaving said all that about the Logan and its tributaries, I caught my Bear River in Curtis Creek, which flows through Hardware Ranch WMA into the Blacksmith Fork. The Blacksmith Fork is the second largest river in the valley, and the fishing is great in mid-summer. Because it’s smaller, it also clears from runoff a lot earlier than the Logan, making it fishable by mid-June in an average/good water year. Unfortunately, probably about 90% of the fish in Blacksmith Fork are browns (or at least the ones I’ve caught). In fact, the DWR has a bonus limit of four additional brown trout, meaning you can catch and keep eight brown trout per day (as of 2023).\nThe ratio of cutts to browns in Curtis Creek is better than the mainstem Blacksmith Fork, probably something like 4 to 1 rather than 9 to 1. For my cutt slam, I caught the fish in mid-April as Curtis Creek drains a small area and is probably the first creek in the area to clear from runoff. Rock Creek, which flows into Blacksmith Fork a little lower, also has some cutts and clears relatively early as well. If one drives on the forest road through Hardware Ranch, the road eventually meets Rock Creek again higher up. It’s easy to park near the bridge and fish up the meadow, or move downstream and fish through some smaller meadows and into a small canyon. I’ve done this a few times and caught a lot of fish (mostly browns). The only drawback is that it’s about an hour drive from Logan each way so I don’t fish it that often, though neither does anyone else. In the spring and summer, there is a lot of dispersed camping in the area and people like to use the forest road through Hardware Ranch to see how fast they can drive their side-by-sides.\n A local enjoying the Blacksmith Fork river.\nThe other option for a Bear River cutt is Left Hand Fork of the Blacksmith, which flows past a number of campgrounds on Left Hand Fork road. This is one of my favorite places to fish early in the season (before Memorial Day) because it clears early and there are a lot of fish, but it’s almost all browns, in my experience. Unfortunately the quantity of dispersed camping and campgrounds means it is overrun by Memorial Day, and the area is an absolute nightmare during the height of summer. I’ve nearly experienced dog attacks and ATV crashes on Left Hand Fork Road. People seem to enjoy dropping their trailer or tent in a spot and reserving it for the entire summer. The forest service has made some efforts to better organize the dispersed camping and enforce the 14 day stay limit, though as far as I can tell, these efforts do not yet seem to be effective.\n Left Hand Fork of Blacksmith Fork.\nIf I were trying to catch the Bear River cutt, I’d probably start in the upper Logan or Franklin Basin, and failing that, go to Right Hand Fork. The fishing in the Logan and Franklin Basin is easier because they are bigger waters and there is more room to cast and wade. But, if those two didn’t work for whatever reason, Right Hand Fork is almost a sure thing if you can find a spot to make a cast without spooking the fish or get tangled in the brush. Spawn Creek is also a good option, but it requires a 15 to 20 minute hike up to the beaver ponds, and there are brooks and browns in addition to cutthroats.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Raft River Mountains\nThis is widely accepted to be the most difficult fish in the slam to catch. For most people, the Raft River Range is the farthest drive, the creeks are tiny, and there isn’t a ton of information on where to catch the fish. Some of the online promotional videos I’ve seen show people fishing water in private land or only make vague references to access points. I couldn’t figure any of this out so I stuck to the most obvious water: Onemile Creek. There is a forest road that goes up it, and my research seemed to suggest this was the best bet.\nWhen I drove up the forest road, there was a jeep parked in a turnout: another guy and his wife also looking to catch the Yellowstone for their slam. From that turnout, they mentioned there is a relatively well-defined hole only a short walk up the creek where they’d brought a fish up. Onemile creek is very small and doesn’t even look like it can hold fish, but unlike a lot of creeks this size in Utah, it wasn’t that brushy. I started downstream of the hole they mentioned, fished up to it, and had absolutely no success. I hooked a shockingly large fish in that hole, got it to the surface and lost it. I made a few more casts, but it was clear the fish wasn’t coming back. I continued fishing up Onemile Creek for a while, and found no signs of life.\n Onemile creek is small.\nAt that point I wasn’t sure what to do. Downstream of the turnout where I first parked, there was another bad looking forest road that went across the creek and into another drainage. The creek just seems to be called Sawmill Canyon and I wasn’t sure it was even fishable, but I had read that it held Yellowstone cutts. I also wasn’t sure if I could get my car up the road so I rode my mountain bike on the road over a short hill and then up the canyon. I picked an arbitrary point to take the quick hike down to the creek from the road. Sawmill Canyon was even smaller than Onemile and was very brushy.\nThis all seemed futile as I started fishing but pretty quickly thought I had some fish hitting my dry fly that I let sink in some of the holes. I wasn’t entirely sure they were bites, but it did give me motivation to keep fishing. Within less than an hour, I caught a small Yellowstone cutt out of Sawmill. I caught a few more, all smaller than 6 inches. The fishing isn’t easy, but there seem to be more fish than in Onemile, and I think it gets less pressure. It wasn’t all that hard to get to either, the walk/bike in was maybe a mile or mile and a half.\n Sawmill Canyon is small and brushy.\nThere is a nice forest service campground nearby on Clear Creek, along with lots of dispersed camping. We were going to try and summit Bull Moutain the next day (highest point in the Raft River Range), but it started thunderstorming early in the morning so we left and drove back to Cache Valley. Clear Creek is quite fun to fish as there are a ton of fish that seemed to look like cutts, but I think they are Inland Redband trout, as they are missing the orange slash under the jaw and have a pink lateral stripe. The DWR’s website does not mention Clear Creek as a possible water in which to find Yellowstones.\n Trout from Clear Creek. I think these are Inland Redband trout.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Boulder Mountain\nLiving in Cache Valley is an advantage for reaching the Bear River and Yellowstone cutts (the Raft River is less than a two hour drive), but it is a decided disadvantage for the next fish I attempted to catch, the Colorado River cutt. This one is probably slightly easier to catch than the Yellowstone, but the geography of its native waters make it a long trip from Cache Valley. I had a trip planned to the Capitol Reef area for some hiking, so I did research on streams near the park entrance that might hold Colorado River cutts. When we visit Capitol Reef we like to stay at a nice forest service campground about a half hour from the park entrance. The DWR website lists Pine Creek as close to that area so I started there with really no other plan if that didn’t work. Pine Creek flows off the northwest side of Boulder Mountain, but access is at a low enough elevation that isn’t too far of a drive from Bicknell.\n Pine Creek, near Bicknell, UT.\nI could find almost no information on the fishing aside from that single mention on the website so I had no idea what the road condition was, how big the creek was, or where to fish. The road turned out to be a good forest service road that I drove up until I found a spot to pull over and walk to the creek. Where I parked, the road isn’t alongside the creek so you can’t see the water until you get closer. Surprise, surprise, Pine Creek is tiny with what I would characterize as “moderate” brush (a running theme for Utah fly fishing). But, on walking up to the creek, I could see fish!\nDespite the look of the creek, it was relatively easy fishing; I walked upstream, found a brush-free spot, made a cast with a dry fly, and usually hooked a small fish. I caught a few quickly and had a nice time working my way upstream. I had plans to leave and fish the Fremont which is supposed to hold larger brown trout but as I was packing up after fishing Pine Creek, I stepped on my rod and broke it. I didn’t realize this until I drove to the Fremont, made a cast, and the top of my rod flew off. That was something like the third time I’d broken a rod, and there would be (and will be) more.\n\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Salt Lake City Area\nI left the Bonneville for last as I assumed it would be the easiest. I am in Salt Lake City often enough that I thought I’d just catch it quickly when in the area. Unfortunately, by the end of the summer, I just hadn’t gotten around to it. After an airport run, I thought I’d just go to one the creeks that flows out of the Wasatch into the valley. The closest water to the airport I could find was Mill Creek, which is right above the City and holds Bonnies according to the DWR website. I’d never been up there so I had no idea what the fishing was like.\nIt turns out Mill Creek Canyon is a very popular place to recreate on a Sunday afternoon. And, you have to pay to recreate in the canyon on the way out, which seems very odd. I fought traffic, found a place to park on the road, and walked down to the creek. This was late September and I was surprised to find a little snow on the ground because the sun doesn’t reach the creek in the fall or winter months. The shadows, combined with the warmish air temperature which caused the snow to melt and re-freeze, produced maximum slickness when wading.\n Mill Creek.\nAlso, unsurprisingly, Mill Creek is tiny and moderately brushy, and it looked just okay in terms of fishability. The low light in the canyon made it difficult to see my dry fly and for about the first hour, nothing happened. This was all very annoying because the Bonnie was supposed to be the easy one. I began thinking the DWR made a mistake and regretting my decision to fish Mill Creek. I finally hooked a fish, after a tough, cold wade. On the way out, I had to sit in traffic waiting to pay the fee. I completed the cutt slam in one year, but I feel comfortable saying that will be my last visit to Mill Canyon.\nI probably should have gone to a larger, nicer river to catch the Bonnie and most anglers will drive from Salt Lake City to the north slope of the Uintas to catch the fish there, or fish the Ogden or Weber. All are good options; Mill Creek has the advantage of being twenty minutes from SLC, but the experience is not what we think of in terms of western trout fishing.\n\n\nSummary\nRelative to the other state slams I’ve done or attempted, Utah was the easiest, and is a good starter slam. The driving distances are likely shorter than in Wyoming, and the fishing is pretty easy with the exception of the Yellowstone Cutt. The Bear River and Bonneville should, more or less, be gimmes, with the Colorado River somewhat tougher (though I got lucky Pine Creek was a good spot for me). Catching the Yellowstone out of Sawmill Canyon felt like a miracle, especially after having zero success in Onemile. There are other creeks listed on the DWR website that hold Yellowstones, but my impression is that they require significantly more effort to reach, or flow mostly through private land. I had a hard time figuring out access points. If I were going back, I would give myself some backup options if neither Onemile nor Sawmill worked. The most obvious seems to be Johnson Creek, which I’ve read recently is a good option, and there have been reports of anglers catching large Yellowstones from that water. It is farther from Clear Creek Campground however, and I don’t know what access is like.\nOne additional note on Utah’s slam. Unlike every other state slam, completing the Utah slam is not free; it requires paying a fee of $20. The money is used to fund conservation projects for fish, and Utah DNR trumpets the projects they’ve compeleted with the money. I have mixed feelings about charging. I worry the fee will exclude or dissuade people who would otherwise complete the challenge, but raising money for conservation projects is undoubtedly beneficial. If we’re honest about the socio-economic status of most people who are fly fishing, I doubt the $20 is making much of a difference in whether someone decides to complete the slam. On balance then, it seems like a good idea, and other states should probably implement a similar fee.\nBack to Main Page"

Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows that the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com.

    "text": "Unlike the Utah Slam, which I did over the course of a summer, I attempted the Wyoming Slam over the course of a few days. It didn’t work, and I had to make a second trip to Wyoming to complete the slam, but because I don’t live in Wyoming, I initially wanted to minimize driving back-and-forth. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about this approach. I definitely felt rushed the whole trip, and it felt like I was doing more driving than fishing. On the other hand, I knocked out three of the four fish I needed in about five days, including the fish farthest from my house that I wanted to avoid having to drive back for. When I had a free weekend near the end of summer, I drove back to Wyoming to target one fish, and it was one of the closest to my house. I wouldn’t want to fish this way again, but for most of us who don’t live in western Wyoming, trying to complete the slam in a week or so is the most viable option.\nDespite the long driving distances, I thought it would be easier than the Utah slam; Wyoming has more options for each fish, bigger water (less brush), and at the time, had more resources online to help plan a fishing trip. Wyoming has a program called “Instream Flow” that provides helpful information on lots of different rivers and creeks, and a related program called “XStream Angler” in which you receive a hat if you a take a picture of yourself near three qualifying rivers or creeks. This is an easy thing to complete when you do your slam as most waters fished in the slam are also considered “instream flow” rivers. When I did the slam a few years ago, I think they required pictures near seven rivers, but perhaps that was too demanding for most people.\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hobble Creek\nBonneville Cutts are found in rivers that flow into the Great Basin. Utah further separates species into Bear River and Bonneville, while Wyoming makes no such distinct. I don’t know what the scientific case is for calling the Bear River and Bonneville separate species, and I suspect Utah does it because they can’t have a fish slam with only three species. Regardless, Hobble Creek flows into the Bear River via the Smiths Fork from the Wyoming Range outside of Cokeville, Wyoming. It’s only about an hour and a half from my home in Cache Valley, Utah so this was the first place I started. I’ve now done quite a bit of hiking, camping, and fishing in the Wyoming Range and adjacent Salt River Range, both of which are incredibly underrated.\nMy driving plan was somewhat convoluted, and in retrospect, I did not do this correctly. Once I’d caught the Bonneville, I planned to go up a road that follows the Smiths Fork north, take that up and over to the Tri-Basin divide, fish for the Colorado River Cutthroat in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to fish for Snake River cutthroat. This didn’t work because the road up Smiths Fork to connect with the Tri-Basin divide slowly deteriorated as we drove up it. Eventually, we came to a spot where the road turned into a giant mud puddle and though it looked like I might be able to get my truck through it, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and turned around. I once got stuck in mud on a dirt road in Kansas, and that experience scarred me so deeply I have become extremely risk averse with muddy roads. Unfortunately, this meant going all the way back out to Cokeville and driving around the southern end of the Wyoming Range. It also changed the creeks I would fish, which ended up having significant consequences.\nHobble Creek is reached by a long drive on relatively good forest roads up until the last mile or so when there is a creek crossing. High clearance vehicles without four-wheel drive should have no problem but I wouldn’t take a sedan across the creek. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a spot for dispersed camping at the crossing that I could see, so it’s important to get to the campground farther down the road. There is also a parking lot for Lake Alice, which is about a two mile hike from the campground, a nice sidetrip with an interesting geological history. This area is used quite a bit by locals visiting the lake on daytrips, but there was only one other site taken in the campground. I think the creek receives a moderate amount of pressure farther downstream as I’ve seen a few people fishing it the times I’ve been up there.\n Into a big brown on Hobble Creek.\nAlice Creek, which flows out of Lake Alice, comes into Hobble right at the campground, and the flow is greater after their confluence. When you first enter Hobble Creek canyon on the forest road, before the campground, Coantag Creek joins up with Hobble Creek and also significantly increases the flow into Hobble. I think most people fish from this point downstream because it’s a bigger creek so they assume it holds bigger fish, and it’s the closest road access for people who drive up for the day.\nI’ve only fished upstream from Coantag Creek, on Hobble Creek up to Alice Creek, then above Alice Creek. Besides the increased pressure, the problem with fishing downstream of Coantag Creek is that it if you stay in the campground, you’d likely have to get back in your car and drive downstream approximately a mile or two to get back to this water. That didn’t make much sense to me so I just walked down the road to get downstream of the campground then fished back up to it. I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I can promise there are very large fish, both cutts and browns, upstream of Coantag Creek near the campground.\nWhen I was fishing for the slam, it was my first time fishing Hobble. On the Logan, my “home river,” there is a fish in every soft spot on the river, almost behind every rock. Because that was what I was used to, and I didn’t have a lot of experience fishing other rivers, I expected to have higher catch rates in Hobble Creek. In fact, when we arrived at the campground in the late afternoon, I walked upstream of the campground and found a nice hole with an undercut bank. Almost immediately, I hooked into a large fish that ended up being a brown. I wasn’t expecting brown trout in Hobble Creek as I thought it was all cutthroat, so though it was a 15 inch plus fish, it didn’t count for the slam. That first fish fooled me because I thought the fishing was going to be easy but I had a more difficult time catching a cutthroat the next morning.\nI wasted a lot of time fishing spots that in retrospect weren’t likely to hold fish. Eventually, I caught exactly one cutthroat and a few additional browns, and had my first fish of the Wyoming slam. Hobble Creek has since become one of my favorite fishing and camping spots, and I’ve subsequently caught very large (nearly 20 inch) cutthroats in the creek, though there are perhaps not as many fish as I would expect given how good the water looks.\nOn that first trip, the large brown I caught made for a delicious dinner. I usually practice catch and release, and I would never keep a cutthroat in a native drainage, but I view browns in these drainages as an invasive species so I sometimes eat them.\n Catch and cook.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Attempt Number 1, Various Creeks\nAs I described above, an attempt to take the road which parallels the Smiths Fork over to Tri-Basin Divide didn’t work as the road was impassable. I was worried this was going to happen and it added hours of driving. Smiths Fork above Cokeville, near the turnoff to the road to Hobble Creek, is a large-ish river that is supposed to have very good fishing. However, access is a bit of a problem as most of the river is private, and there is nowhere to camp nearby. This could be an option for the Bonneville if one wanted to stay in a hotel near Cokeville, though I believe the Smiths Fork also has browns in it. I chose Hobble Creek because it offered convenient camping. I later fished the Smiths Fork up much higher, closer to the Tri-Basin divide, which has much better forest road access (the road I was attempting to connect to) and flows through public land. There is abundant and excellent dispersed camping in this area, but surprisingly, the fishing wasn’t very good for me over two nights of camping. I caught a few fish here and there but really struggled. I’ve only fished it that one time so I’m not sure if that was bad technique on my part or if the fishing really isn’t that great.\nThe vast majority of people attempting the slam center their efforts on Tri-Basin divide. One can catch the Bonneville in upper Smiths Fork, drive a very short way to catch the Colorado River in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to catch the Snake River. All three of these fish exist within maybe a five mile radius. Because I couldn’t connect up to Tri-Basin, I drove around the southern end of the Wyoming Range to fish the creeks coming off the east side of the range, then connected over to the Greys on forest roads via McDougal Gap. Again, literally every Wyoming Cutt Slam report online says to fish LaBarge Creek, but I didn’t want to have to drive up LaBarge Creek road then down Greys River road as I thought that would add significant time, and there aren’t any campgrounds on LaBarge Creek or in the Tri-Basin area. Because the Wyoming Fish and Game lists a number of creeks on the east side of the Wyoming Range that hold cutts, I thought I would just fish these. The night after leaving Hobble, we camped at Sacajawea Campground which is located on Middle Piney Creek.\n Middle Piney creek near Sacajawea Campground. Small, but should have given more effort. The smoke started moving in.\nSacajawea is another amazing, nearly deserted forest service campground in Wyoming that should be crowded. Unfortunately, Middle Piney Creek was tiny and my brief efforts to fish on evening arrival didn’t yield anything. Here is where feeling time pressured got to me. Instead of giving Middle Piney a real chance, the next day we decided to begin heading to Greys River Road and fish along the way as the drive over to the Greys would cross a number of creeks. Before I complain about the fishing, I will say the scenery on this drive is spectacular.\nThe first stop was North Piney Creek. The fishing was slow but I did manage to catch a brook trout, which was not helpful. The second stop was North Cottonwood Creek, which is on the forest road which goes over McDougal Gap. After about an hour of fishing unsuccessfully, I finally caught a small brook trout. This was very frustrating, and out of ideas, I gave up and we drove over McDougal Gap to the Greys River.\n North Piney Creek. Looks good, caught nothing but a few brooks.\n Same story on North Cottonwood.\n Driving between basins on east side of Wyoming Range.\n\n\nSnake River Cutthroat–Greys River\nThe Greys River forms in the Tri-Basin divide and Greys River Road runs its entire length, from there to Alpine, WY where the Greys meets the Snake in Palisades Resevoir. The road is well maintained and well traveled, and while this area isn’t exactly deserted, its not so crowded as to be unpleasant. The scenery is spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be very good as well. We stayed in Forest Park Campground which is just upriver from where the forest road over McDougal Gap meets Greys River Road. Forest Park was also mostly empty, though a lot of people prefer to disperse camp along the Greys River.\n Over McDougal Gap into Greys River drainage, forest road at bottom left. It had been smoky all day.\nI eventually caught my Snake River cutt in the Greys. It was not spectacular fishing in terms of catch rate or size, but the surroundings made up for much of that. It was very hot when I was there, and nothing really started happening until late in the afternoon. I’d already been fishing for a few hours so I caught maybe three or four medium size cutts and called it. We had a very long drive planned the next day, and I was frustrated after my lack of success fishing for the Colorado River cutt.\nOddly, I’ve never fished the Greys again, despite passing by it a number of times. There isn’t a good reason for that, other than I’ve never really gotten around to it. I would like to drive its entire length from Alpine to Tri-Basin divide. Years later, for my Western Native Trout Challenge, I fished the very top of LaBarge Creek and caught a Colorado River cutt, but didn’t make it down to the Greys. I’d like to determine whether my slow evenings on both the Smiths Fork and Greys River were aberrations or if the fishing is not as good as reports suggest. One other note on Greys River road: when leaving Greys River Road and entering Alpine, a stop at Melvin’s Brewery is mandatory.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Greybull River\nWas the drive from Alpine, though Jackson, Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, out to Cody, and to the Greybull River a frustrating slog through bumper-to-bumper traffic? Yes, and I won’t relive it by elaborating further. I’ve now driven through Yellowstone twice in the summer, and I’m sorry to say it’s just awful.\nOutside of Cody, and closer to Meeteetse, WY, there are quite a few possibilities for the Yellowstone cutthroat. Both the Greybull and Wood River are supposed to have fantastic fishing, and I chose the Greybull because of the forest service campground on the river and because Jack Creek flows into the Greybull at the campground; if the mainstem didn’t work, I would have a backup.\n Sunset over Jack Creek Campground.\nThe road from Meeteetse to Jack Creek Campground, on the Greybull, is long and rough, but as per usual, there was not a single other campsite taken. This is incredible to me given how close it is to the hordes nearby in Yellowstone. The scenery is incredible, the river looks like a classic, western blue-ribbon trout stream, and the grizzly bears are, apparently, plentiful. Jack Creek campground is a place I wanted to stay for a week, and fortunately, the fishing lived up to its promise.\nThis was by far, the most enjoyable experience of the whole trip. The evening we arrived, I fished the river almost behind my campsite and immediately caught a few nice cutthroat. There were fish rising everywhere, and it’s clear the river doesn’t see a lot of pressure. The next morning I fished again, and again caught quite a few fish. The Greybull is extremely slick to wade, and I kept an eye out for grizzlies, but the fishing was amazing. My catch rate was high, the average fish size was probably about 12 inches, with a few pushing 15. These fishing experiences are so enjoyable, but they make for a short story: arrived, got a nice campsite, and caught a lot of fish in beautiful scenery.\n Greybull River in the morning.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Attempt Number 2, North Cottonwood Creek\nI went back to the eastern slope of the Wyoming Range in mid-September, after my summer trip. And, just like my summer trip, I made the mistake of not going to LaBarge Creek. The reason for this is that we wanted to do a backpacking trip, and there is no backpacking along LaBarge Creek, only driving. Instead, I decided we would hike up North Piney Creek, and I assumed, like the Utah rivers I’m familiar with, that increasing elevation would increase the cutthroat to non-cutthroat ratio.\n The east slope of the Wyoming Range in fall.\nWe only had a weekend, and work delays meant we left too late on Friday. We arrived at the North Piney Creek trailhead too late in the day to get very far up the river, though I met a guy coming down the trail who had fished. He assured me he caught some cutthroats, though also gave me an ominious warning about the start of hunting season. It turned out that after hiking up the trail about two miles, we hiked directly into hunters who parked at a higher trailhead reachable on a quad or side-by-side. In other words, by going up the drainage away from the main road, we actually hiked into the crowds. We inadvertently setup camp nearly in the dark very close to a staging area. This meant we woke up at about five a.m. to the sound of quads and hunters talking. Not a great camping experience!\nI managed to fish for a few minutes before it got too dark and caught lots of fish. Unfortunately, they were all five inch brook trout. It’s my understanding that back East a lot of people pursue brookies and view them with reverance, but I absolutely loathe them. They don’t belong in the West, they never get very big in western rivers, and there always seem to be a million of them when trying to catch a native fish.\nThe next morning we hiked farther up North Piney Creek, but the water got very small very quickly, and I didn’t have much fishing success. The number of hunters and off-road vehicles was a legitimate issue too as it was a total zoo in the area. I also hunt and have no moral objection to it, though I get annoyed with the use of gas-powered vehicles to cover ground in the backcountry. We decided to hike out and try our luck elsewhere. Hilariously, almost at the trailhead where we parked, and below where all the hunters drove onto the trail, there was a bull elk bugling like crazy from some pine trees.\nWe drove from North Piney to North Cottonwood. As in the summer, my plan was to use the road along North Cottonwood to connect over to Greys River Road, then out to Alpine, and back to Cache Valley. I was also hoping that because the creek was right along a road there would be fewer hunters. That was a poor assumption. Nearly every plausible dispersed campsite was taken and we were forced to camp in what was essentially a turnout along the road. The good news is that I had all day to catch at least one cutthroat from North Cottonwood Creek, which the Wyoming Game and Fish says is “one of the state’s finest fly-fishing streams,” and one in which Colorado River cutthroat are “common.”\nIt is definitely full of brook trout. For hours I caught dozens of them. As usual, the average size was about eight inches and it’s just not very satisfying fishing. It was getting dark and I was getting frustrated. I began to suspect that the cutthroat were deeper in the water column but I really wanted to use a dry fly to catch one. But, every cast on top of the water just brought up brooks. This is an experience I’ve had in a number of places with small but aggressive fish attacking the surface, but larger fish remaining deeper. Eventually, I think I just got lucky. I cast to an undercut bank and my dry fly got sucked under the surface, maybe only a foot, if that. I hooked a fish and it immediately looked different. I had caught my Colorado River cutt.\nWere I to do this experience today, I would pretty quickly switch to a dry-dropper, or even just a pure nymph setup. At the time, I didn’t really use nymphs or dropper setups effectively, and was really stuck on trying to fish exclusively with drys. I’ve also gotten better at using a dry similar to a wet fly by allowing it to sink. This is most effective on very small creeks by allowing the dry to float through the whitewater and go under into a hole. I’ve even begun tying my version of a wet fly doing something like an Adams, but without any hackle to allow it to better sink. When fishing with it, I don’t add any floatant and after it soaks, the fly will start to sink a little, especially when it encounters whitewater or riffles. This can be very effective at getting the fly just deep enough to entice a trout sitting at the bottom of a hole on a small creek. The trout still needs to move up, so it isn’t the same as nymphing where one attempts to get the fly all the way down to the fish, but I think it simulates a floating bug that may have just gotten sucked underneath the current a bit. North Cottonwood may be slightly too big of water to do this a lot, but I could imagine allowing a fly to sink just six inches or so under an undercut bank. In fact, this is almost exactly how I caught my cutt, though it wasn’t purposeful when I did it then. Does this count as dry fly fishing? Not really, but I can say I caught all my Wyoming fish, as with all my Utah fish, on dry flies, even if they were not always floating.\n Over McDougal Gap in September. Compare this picture without smoke to the one above.\n\n\nSummary\nPerhaps part of the reason why the Greybull was so enjoyable is that once I caught my fish the evening we arrived, the pressure was off. It was the last stop before I went home, and I had caught three of the four. Again, the lesson (for me, anyway) seems to be not to rush things. I wish I could have stayed longer at each spot and really learned the river or creek. As I mentioned, I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I’ve had some amazing experiences on that water because I’ve been able to explore it more and understand the fish in the creek better. When fishing for an evening or morning on the way to the next spot, one doesn’t get to unlock the fishing on a particular water at all.\nOn the other hand, most of us have jobs, families, regular lives to live, and we can’t spend three or four days in one spot if we’re trying to finish the slam. Perhaps two full nights at each spot is optimal, but that means eight nights, not including driving days. And, if catching a particular species isn’t successful, then one has to decide pretty quickly whether they are going to move on, or burn all their time working on one fish.\nThe Wyoming slam was the first slam and remains the most famous for a reason. The driving was a hassle, especially through Yellowstone at the height of summer. I had done it a few years before and promised myself never again, then I did it again. This time, I really won’t do it again. But, Western Wyoming is an amazing place and there is so much to do and see besides Teton and Yellowstone. My trip didn’t even touch the Bighorns or Wind River range. I would love to go back to the Meeteetse area and fish the Greybull again, but also the Wood and the smaller creeks in that area. It’s rumored that Fenn’s Treasure was hidden in the Wood River drainage, though recent reports suggest it was in Yellowstone National Park which is to the west of the Shoshone National Forest, where most of the Greybull and Wood River drainages are located.\nPerhaps because I live in Utah, the Wyoming slam felt bigger, more interesting, and more classically “western.” There weren’t any tiny, brushy creeks on this trip, and though I didn’t go to any of the really famous Wyoming waters, the fishing was mostly very good. These are big, but not too big rivers, pressure is light, campgrounds are quiet, and the scenery is excellent.\nIn some ways the Wyoming Cutt Slam is easier than the Utah one because the fishing is probably a little more straightforward, with the exception of the Colorado River Cutt. I think LaBarge Creek is the obvious place to go now, though I’ve read reports online that it can sometimes be difficult fishing. I fished it in the Tri-Basin Divide once, after I’d completed my slam, and I caught some small cutts without too much difficulty.\nThe Bonneville could also be a little tricky if the Smiths Fork or Hobble Creek don’t work, and in both of those you’ll have to fight through the browns, and possibly rainbows or brooks. I know nothing about the other creeks listed on the Fish and Game’s website, but when researching this trip, they didn’t seem like good options for one reason or another.\nThe logistics in Wyoming are more difficult than Utah however, and if for some reason you struck out on a particular river and had to come back, it’s likely going to be a lot of travel time. I also got relatively lucky with the weather, with the only real challenge coming on the Greys where it was very hot. The air quality in the Wyoming Range was not great due to smoke, but fly fishing is not aerobic so it wasn’t a big deal other than obscuring some of the scenery. Summers in the West are increasingly unpredictable and very hot weather, fires, smoke, or heavy rain can derail plans. For these reasons, I think Utah is still probably the easier first cutt slam to attempt, but it’s close between the two.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "Rock Creek, near Logan, UT.\nI haven’t been fly fishing for that long; I grew up in Southern California which is not exactly a hotbed of trout fishing. I occassionally rod-and-reel fished when camping in the Sierras and in school at the University of Colorado. It was only when I moved to Utah in 2016 that I began serious fly fishing. It helps that I had a skilled mentor who taught me his style. My first summer of fly fishing, I mostly didn’t catch a thing, and I got so frustrated I kind of gave up one it.\nUtah introduced it’s Cutt Slam shortly after I improved as an angler, and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. it forced me to learn more about the fish, explore waters I normally wouldn’t fish, and challenge myself by learning new techniques to tackle new waters.\nWhile I extensively researched the places where I’d try to catch fish for my challenge, I was frustrated with the information on the internet. I found most websites to be full of fish pictures and short on details. This made things difficult for me because I was unsure how to prepare, what kinds of flies to use (though I think this is largely overrated), what kind of water I’d be fishing, in some cases where or how to access the streams. Most importantly, I wanted to have a good experience: good fishing with small crowds, nice scenery, etc. As a result, this site is short on pictures but I hope, long on details. For most of us, it isn’t feasible to drive four hours to a fishing spot and not be successful. I think a lot of the websites suggest that potential anglers have unlimited time and money to catch fish. I also don’t show fish pictures that often,and mostly focus on the water and scenery. When researching my own slams I wanted to know what the water looked like to get a sense of size, type, etc. I know what fish look like.\nA summary of my completed and in progress slams can be found here. I provide details on where and how I caught my fish."

    "text": "I have completed two slams and am working on two more. I debate whether the Wyoming or Utah slam is easier to complete, but I am absolutely certain about which one is the most difficult. Nevada has it all–long driving distances, small, brushy creeks, difficult to find and catch fish, and unlike Utah and Wyoming which require catching four fish, Nevada has six(!) in its slam. I have not completed the Nevada slam, and according to their angler recognition program, fewer than 30 people have ever completed it in the ten years or so it’s been around. I have caught three of the six, and it is just very, very difficult. But in my mind, this also makes it the most interesting and impressive!\nOf the three fish I’ve caught, the first took me almost a full day and a half of fishing in the middle of nowhere, the second felt like an absolute miracle, and third required a backpack into the mountains to get to the fish. Nevada also refers to their contest as a “fish slam” rather than a “trout slam” because two of the fish are not trout. Bull trout is characterized as a char, while mountain whitefish is a different kind of salmonid. I admittedly don’t understand enough about fish biology to know the differences between these species.\nAt the time I started my slam, Nevada provided significantly less information on waters to find native fish than either Wyoming or Utah. They have since improved, but in 2019 it was literally a typed list of waters. I had to sort of cross-reference the list with accessible waters, what they looked like, how fishable they were likely to be, and what access was like. I was concerned about high levels of brush and impassable roads. One resource I have found to be helpful is Nevada’s annual Trophy Fish book, which can be found via the webpage here. The book lists people who have completed the slam each year and, importantly, where they caught their fish. Though the book changes every year, I was able to access old copies by editing the url. I used the waters frequently mentioned in the book to target my search.\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hendry’s Creek\nAs with my two previous slams, the Bonneville was the first fish I caught in Nevada. The fish exists in a few isolated mountain streams on the east side of the state, and while it wasn’t a short drive for me to get to the Great Basin National Park area, this was about the closest, easily catcheable fish. The Yellowstone is closer to me, but I hadn’t figured out how I was going to catch it yet. I also happened to be camping in central Utah, so I decided to make a one night detour out to Nevada.\nThe mountains in Nevada are unique because they tend to be long, narrow and rise steeply up from the Great Basin. Nevada is the dryest state in the country due to rain-shadowing from the Sierra Nevada, but it’s amazing how quickly the scenery can change with a little elevation. Utah is not too different, but the mountains tend to be a little bigger and a little wider, not giving the same overall feeling that Nevada mountains do of being “sky islands”. The Great Basin, especially in the northern part of the state, looks unlike almost anywhere else I’ve been in the world.\nThe amazing thing to me about the Bonneville trout in Nevada is that the streams disappear into the desert when they come out of the mountains. The fish traveled up these creeks as Lake Bonneville shrunk, then disappeared, and they’ve been there ever since, living in just a few miles of tiny creeks.\nHendry’s Creek is perhaps the easiest creek to access to catch the Bonneville as its accessible by a mostly okay forest road with dispersed camping nearby. One may also fish the creeks in the national park itself, but I’d been to Great Basin before and didn’t want to pay the entrance fee, and worry about finding a campsite. Some of the best target waters in the park had burned recently as well. It also seemed like Hendry’s Creek was almost a sure thing. One of the reports I read online suggested the guy rolled up to the creek, got out of his truck, caught his fish and left. I did not have the same success.\nThere is an obvious parking area at the end of the forest road very near the creek. The forest road itself is barely passable with a high-clearance two wheel drive vehicle. The creek near the parking area is small, but not particularly brushy and made for relatively easy casting. Unfortunately, there was no evidence fish existed in the creek. I didn’t bring a fish up, didn’t see a fish, and certainly didn’t hook a fish. I walked upstream, as I always do, and had no success. My original plan was to catch the fish and drive home, but it became clear that I’d have to stay another night. I found one of the dispersed campsites and setup there, with one another site just below me also taken, though I don’t think the area sees a lot of traffic.\n Start of the trail up Hendry’s Creek.\nIn fly fishing, like many things, when in doubt, go higher. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t, but I believe it works, so it’s one of my go-to moves if I’m not catching fish. After not catching anything the night before, and thinking that perhaps the fish had moved higher up the creek because it was June and too warm down low, I got on my mountain bike and rode up the trail to the wilderness boundary. Bikes are not allowed in wilderness areas (though horses are, which makes no sense to me), so I walked from there. One of the issues with Hendry’s is that the ditch in which the creek runs is quite steep and brushy, so in many places it isn’t that easy to access the creek. From above, you can also look down into the creek and presumably see fish, if there were any there. I saw no fish.\n There is a creek with fish in there somewhere.\nDespite this, I decided at basically a random spot that I was high enough and I should start fishing. Spots were few and far between but I got down into the creek and dapped or flipped my fly into a few holes. After maybe an hour of this, I hooked a fish and almost immediately lost it, giving me flashbacks to Onemile Creek. I can often tell when a fish isn’t hooked well and I tried to be gentle, but it came off. This is a common occurrence fly fishing, and even though you only have to catch one fish to count for a slam, you often end up “catching” more because you lose a few. It’s frustrating but part of the deal. But, at least there were fish somewhere in the creek.\nI fished on and on, and finally hooked another. I was beginning to get worried, and because I lost the first fish, I aggressively flung the second fish nearly onto the trail. This was not easy fishing, and I’m not sure how quickly others have caught their fish in Hendry’s, but I struggled. Getting in and out of the little drainage to get around brush was tough, finding holes to dap into was tough, and catching the fish was tough. In fact, identifying holes where there might be a fish was easy, but getting to the hole and actually catching the fish was a struggle. I stopped fishing almost immediately after I had my fish. The scenery was fine, as the mountains had some nice red rocks and pine trees higher up the trail.\n My fish came out of this hole, which was approximately six inches across and three inches deep.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 1\nMost people completing the Nevada slam will come from the west side of the state because that is where the population centers are. For them, the Lahontan will be easier because it is native to drainages that flow toward or near the west side of the state. Unfortunately for me, it is more difficult to access the Lahontan from the east side as one inevitably has to drive across half the state to access waters it seems more difficult to catch as compared to the western rivers such as the Truckee. For most people then, my situation will not apply because the obvious answer is just to fish the Truckee in Reno.\nI dislike driving long distances so I sought the water farthest to the east that holds Lahontans and settled on the Marys River which flows out of the Jarbidge Mountains toward the Humboldt River east of Elko. This was a mistake. Had I gone farther, to the Elko area, there are creeks with Lahontans that flow off the east side of the Independence Mountain Range, and one in particular, Gance Creek, shows up in a lot of articles as an easy place to catch them. But, because I tried to save myself some driving time, I drove north from the 80 onto a dirt road for almost 40 miles. Outside of Wells it starts as Metropolis Road and passes the abandoned mining town of Metropolis, then continues on as Deeth-O’Neil County Road. The town of Metropolis is worth a stop, and the plaque explains that it died from a combination of getting cut off from its water supply, and a plague of jackrabbits and mormon crickets.\nAt the turnoff from Deeth-O’Neil Road, I had to cross the river on a bridge, go up and over a hill, across a plateau, then over another small ridge, and drop back down to the river miles upstream. The road was well-maintained until the plateau section, and where it drops back down to the river. It is very steep, with some small, muddy creek crossings. I would only attempt this drive in a high-clearance vehicle, and though I did it with two wheel drive, it seemed iffy. Once at the river, there are a number of nice dispersed campsites. The area is somewhat well-used but the night I was there, only one other group was camping well away from us.\n Near lower Marys River. There were no trout here but the scenery was nice.\nThe Marys River in this area looked fishable. I was worried there wouldn’t be enough water as I was there in early September, but the river was bigger than I thought. It looked a little stagnant in places, but I didn’t see any reason why there wouldn’t be trout. To make a long story short, there weren’t any trout in the river. I fished without success, spent the night, and faced a decision. Should I continue looking for trout, or move on to another creek? T Creek was on the same road I came in on, and also is supposed to hold Lahontan, so I thought I’d try that. That also proved to be futile, and it was much harder fishing because it was so small and brushy. It occurred to me to go higher, but I wasn’t sure how much higher I had to go, and this was a brief weekend trip so I was facing some time pressure. On my way back to Utah, I wanted to stop in the northeast corner of Nevada and try to catch a Yellowstone.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Goose Creek\nI abandoned the search for a Lahonton and made the decision to head toward Goose Creek. This was another long drive out, through the town of Jackpot for gas, then across another set of dirt roads to the Goose Creek area. As the Nevada DWF makes a point of saying, the Yellowstone will likely be the hardest fish to catch because it exists in only a few creeks and they are all on private land. I really didn’t want to figure out how to ask for permission, so I had a strategy. The first creek I would come across on the road was Little Goose Creek, and using Caltopo and OnX, it looked like there might be some public access to the water. Then, if I could cross a small piece of private, I could access a small canyon through which Little Goose flowed and was entirely public.\nLittle Goose Creek crosses the road at an intersection of two well maintained dirt roads. The creek was small but not brushy and looked somewhat deep. I was hoping I’d get lucky here, catch the fish in a few minutes and be able to leave. I began walking up Little Goose, casting my dry fly, but having no success. I’m pretty sure this was public land but very quickly, I came to posted private land that I wasn’t willing to cross, so that was that for Little Goose Creek. I got back in my truck and headed toward Trout Creek.\nI had read that this entire area belonged to one family with a few ranches. I’d also read a report online of another angler saying they caught their Yellowstone in Trout Creek, which flows into Goose Creek. That angler reported using a dispersed campsite made available by the ranch on Trout Creek. That is where I was headed, though I was somewhat apprehensive about using a campsite supposedly available to the public. As I turned onto the road up Trout Creek, I was greeted with this sign.\n A very warm welcome to anglers!\nSo, was I allowed to fish on Trout Creek or not? It would be easy to deny I was an environmentalist if questioned, but the top sign indicates sportsmen are welcome, while the bottom sign indicates they are not. I remained apprehensive, but sure enough, a few miles up Trout Creek road was what looked to be a campsite. We stopped there, and I drove up higher on the creek to fish that evening. I tried to drive as high as I could, but eventually the road disintegrated to such a point that I started fishing and walking up river. There was no evidence of fish, though a bull elk was bugling very close to where I was fishing.\n Trout Creek did not live up to its name.\nThe area has surprisingly nice scenery, looking like a mix between high desert and pine forest. That night I tried to decide whether I should go up even higher on Trout Creek or head over to Goose Creek, the main water in which Yellowstones inhabit in Nevada. Given my complete lack of success on Trout Creek, and the fact that I needed to start driving home, we decided to head to Goose Creek. How I was going to fish it was unclear because it is, apparently, all on private property, though it does flow under the road and I was hoping I could just fish off the road.\nThis is where things get interesting. The next morning we drove out, toward Utah and Goose Creek. At a large meadow, the creek flows under the road. I stopped and tried to decide what to do. There was nothing posted that indicated it was private property, and I considered simply walking down to the creek and fishing. I started setting up my rod and immediately saw a cloud of dust on the road in the distance. Was it possible someone was coming to intercept me? I saw that it was a guy in side-by-side with dogs herding cattle. I jumped in my truck and drove down the road to meet him. Our conservation was as follows: “Hey, is this your land?” He looked at me suspiciously and said, “yep.” “Do you mind if I fish in the creek?” His response seemed to indicate that I was out of my mind. “Uh, I guess you can, just watch out for the cattle, I’ll be moving them over there.” In fact, he seemed so skeptical I wondered what the deal was and asked, “Am I the first person to ask you to fish here?” He said, “no, there have been others every once in awhile.” What was going on here, why was he acting like I was crazy? “Are there fish in there?” His response: “I don’t know.” Oh okay, cool, the rancher doesn’t know if there are fish in his creek.\n Goose Creek does not look like a classic trout stream.\nGoose Creek is possibly the worst looking “trout” stream I’ve seen. It was muddy, the banks had been destroyed by cows, there were pies everywhere, and not a tree in sight. It must have been broiling in the summer. To be fair, it had just rained, so maybe the creek was just blown out, but I think it was the cows. I thought, this is completely futile, there is no way I’m going to catch a fish here.\nI immediately realized a dry wasn’t going to work, so I used a dry dropper, which is almost always how I nymph. Of course, there were no signs of life for about the first half hour or so. It really did seem pointless. The rancher came back at one point and asked me if I caught anything. He turned out to be a nice guy despite being baffled that someone would want to fish Goose Creek. I told him no, he laughed and wished me luck, and drove off in his side-by-side.\nIncredibly, shortly after, I felt a fish on my nymph and nearly lost my mind. I couldn’t see the fish until it was almost on the bank because it was so muddy, and at first I thought it was a whitefish it was so pale. It was a large cutthroat, something like 15 inches. I can’t believe a fish that big can survive in that water. I really wish I could tell the rancher that there are indeed large fish in his creek, but I didn’t see him again.\n Yellowstone trout and cow pie from Goose Creek.\nI have no idea how I pulled that off, and I suspect I could spend another week there and not catch another fish. I’m not sure what advice to offer to others. NDOW offers the not terribly helpful advice to ask for permission to fish on Goose Creek at one of the ranch houses. I didn’t see any ranch houses anywhere near the road as everything seemed to be fenced off. In other words, had I not run across the rancher in his side-by-side, I don’t know how I would have asked for permission. I interpret the sign and campsite on Trout Creek as providing permission to fish that water, but I couldn’t catch a fish there. I’m guessing I was maybe two or three miles from the Idaho border, so the fish might just be up higher. Or perhaps, I just needed to fish it longer. It looks like parts of Trout Creek lie on public land very close to the Idaho border. An app like OnX would help immensely as when I was fishing it I couldn’t determine where I was in relation to the public land or the border. The best option, absent asking permission, might be to fish Little Goose Creek for the stretch on which it flows through public land. Maps like CalTopo show public land access to a portion of the creek off the road.\nIn short, I’m glad I don’t have to catch a second Yellowstone cutt in Nevada.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 2\nNevada has some odd bureaucratic requirements for completing the slam. First, they used to require the angler take a picture with their fish. This requirement seems to have vanished from their updated webpages. Second, the angler must print off their form for each fish as they catch it, then mail it to NDOW with the picture. I received an email confirming my submission, and after submitting my Yellowstone, another emailed confirmation from an NDOW employee and a compliment on my fish. I emailed back and told him about striking out on the Marys. His response indicated that the trout are up much higher, which I took to mean the Jarbidge Mountains, the source of the Marys.\nThe Jarbidge Mountains are an undiscovered jem. The Marys River flows out of a drainage on the south side of the mountains, into the Humboldt River and Great Basin, while the Jarbidge River flows off the north side, toward the Snake River, and eventually into the Columbia and to the Pacific. The Jarbidge River is home to bull trout and redband, two of which are required for the Nevada slam, and neither of which I have yet caught. My goal on this trip was the Lahontan.\n The Jarbidge Mountains are a spectacular slice of northern Nevada.\nTo get to the Marys River headwaters, we backpacked in from the Camp Draw trailhead. The forest road coming from the south is good, and connects over the mountains into the town of Jarbidge on the north side of the range. We were there in June, shortly after a late season storm, and the road was wet and muddy in places, but passable. In dry weather, it should be no problem even for sedans. The backpack down to the Marys was fairly short and easy, and we saw two different herds of elk in the mountains. Unsurprisingly, over a three night backpack, we saw no one else in the mountains or at the parking lot.\n We spooked a herd of cow and calf elk.\nWe found an already established campsite right along the river, and I fished only very briefly in the evening. The Marys River was more like a creek here and though parts of it were brushy, most of it looked like good water. There were overhanging branches, some deep pools, and soft spots in the river. It looked like I should easily catch a few fish, except I didn’t. Even when I’m not catching fish, I can usually see evidence of them, like feeding at the surface or fish spooking as I wade upstream. If I don’t see any fish darting away from me as I wade, I get concerned, and I didn’t see anything as I worked upstream. The next morning I decided to hike upstream farther and get higher, though I was already in the headwaters. The most surprising thing about this campsite is that there were a lot of ticks near the river. (Ticks in Nevada, who knew!)\nThe next morning I hiked upstream and as the trail parallels the river, it was easy to look for likely fishing spots. At one spot, amidst the downfall, I could see fish. Finally, the Lahontan in the Marys River! Unless they were brook trout. It was tough getting down to the river, and there was a lot of deadfall which prevented easy wading. I worried that I would only get a few casts before the fish I saw spooked, so I needed to make them count. Sure enough, after about two or three casts, I hooked my Lahonton.\nI was with other people who were more interested in backpacking than watching me fish, so I stopped fishing after that. I also had another goal in mind. If we continued on that trail, we could go up and over a pass, leave the Marys River drainage and enter the Jarbidge River drainage. There I could attempt to catch either a bull trout or redband and bag another fish for my Nevada slam, though if I didn’t get both I’d have to come back to the area anyway.\n Looking down into the Jarbidge River drainage.\nThe hiking was fairly easy to get over the pass, though the north facing slope, down into the Jarbidge River drainage, was still holding quite a bit of snow. We made it a few miles down the Jarbidge River and I tried to do some fishing, but it was still running high and fast, and the gradient was extremely steep. This made it difficult to find holes, and I think I needed to hike lower to find suitable fishing spots. We didn’t do this because we were running out of daylight, and every mile farther down we hiked would be another mile we’d have to hike back up and out. I didn’t catch either a redband or a bull trout, but the Marys River Lahontan has me with three of the six fish needed for the Nevada Native Trout Challenge. I’m not sure if I’ll get to Jarbidge in 2023 as I plan on spending significant time in California completing that state’s challenge. I do plan on targeting a whitefish in the western part of the state in the summer of 2023, however.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "California is my home state and the place where I first learned to rod-and-reel fish. I made semi-annual camping trips with my family into the Sierra, and sometimes caught fish, which we almost always kept and ate. Some of the best fishing experiences I ever had were in the Kennedy Meadows of the Southern Sierra, fishing the South Fork of the Kern. I also had family in the Kernville area, and fished the Kern a number of times growing up, though I can’t remember having much success on that river.\nI am just beginning my California Heritage Trout Challenge, and I’m excited to make some serious progress this coming summer. Because California has high state capacity and a professionalized legislature, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has published a very fancy, glossy brochure that discusses each fish and where to find them. The brochure somewhat confusingly lists twelve total “heritage” trout that exist or existed in California, though anglers only have to catch six to complete the challenge. One of those trout, bull trout, has been extirpated from the state. That leaves eleven.\nA second fish, the Paiute Trout, has a native range comprising a small set of creeks that are currently closed to fishing because the fish is listed under the Endangered Species Act. While anglers can and do catch the fish in other drainages to which they’ve been transported (apparently in the White Mountains), these fish do not qualify for the Heritage Trout Challenge because they are outside their native drainage. The brochure teases that it is possible to catch a Paiute below the closure as some fish apparently wash downstream. I’ve done a lot of research and seen others hint at this possibility, but I don’t know if it’s realistic or not. That seemingly leaves ten total fish.\nEven more confusingly, the brochure lists a second recognition level, that of “Master Angler”, if one catches all eleven species, but that includes the Paiute cutthroat. My impression is that the brochure was published prior to the closure of the Silver Creek drainage, home of the Pauite, so I’m not sure it’s even possible to complete the Master Angler level. References to Master Angler also seem to have been completely scrubbed from any current online sources. My approach will be to catch as many fish as I can to complete the regular challenge and work toward the Master Angler title. Then if I get close, I’ll look into whether it’s even possible to catch a Pauite downstream of the closure. In other words, I’d like to complete the Master Angler level, but I’ll save solving the problem of the Pauite for later. While I expect to finish the regular challenge level this year, I don’t believe I’ll be able to catch all ten in 2023. This puts off the Pauite problem for at least another year. Who knows, maybe Silver Creek will open to fishing in 2024.\nEven though I’ve caught Coastal Rainbows, Kern River Rainbows, and Golden Trout as a child, I’m treating this challenge as a fresh start. I’m not even sure I could locate pictures of me with any of these fish. I was able to catch one fish in 2022, and plan on catching at least five more in the summer of 2023 to complete the first level of the challenge.\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Upper Truckee River\nThe Upper Truckee headwaters are in Meiss Meadows just over a pass from Highway 88 outside of Tahoe. It was a strange experience returning here as I did a backpacking trip to this same area with my father as a teenager in 1998. On that trip, we were trying to get to Showers Lake, and started hiking south from Highway 50. It was a big snow year and we quickly realized we couldn’t make it, so we drove to 88 and tried to hike north. We were blocked by snow again, and backtracked to Meiss Lake and camped there. It was shocking to see how much smaller the lake was in 2022 as compared to 1998.\nMeiss Meadow is a lovely area that’s an easy hike from the highway. The trail crosses the headwaters of the Truckee, but the river here is a little indistinct as it flows through the meadows and picks up water from Meiss Lake and a number of small ponds. We hiked past the river crossing, then ventured off trail down to where I thought the river would be a little narrower and larger. It was still pretty small and somewhat brushy, but there were lots of holes to cast into, and I could immediately see a lot of fish.\n The old Meiss Ranch.\nIt didn’t take long to catch a few Lahontans, and my first qualifying fish for the California Heritage Trout Challenge was in the books. It was a little disconcerting to see how low the water was, especially because it was only mid-July, not that late in the season. It was also disconcerting to see damage from the Caldor Fire at various points along Highway 88 up the canyon. The significant rain and snowfall in the winter of 23 will delay the summer fishing season a bit, but I’m hoping it will temporarily solve some of the water problems in the Sierra.\n Low water on the Upper Truckee in mid-July. Caught a deer unawares.\nMore fish coming, summer 2023.\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "How I Fish",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every angler has their own style, techniques, and preferred ways of doing things. Mine are simply the result of how I learned to fly fish, and adjustments that I’ve made over the years. None of my advice or descriptions are meant to be prescriptive as I’m a big believer in learning to fish your own fish (borrowed from the expression, “hike your own hike”), but I think understanding some basic, fundamental strategies are helpful, especially for new anglers.\n\nFish Upstream\nI fish upstream about 99% of the time. That is, I begin downstream of wherever I think my endpoint will be, and work upstream. If I’m finishing along a road and park in a turnout, I usually fish upstream from my car, then walk back downstream on the road when I’m finished. I do this because I believe most anglers walk downstream from their car, then fish upstream back to their car. If people consistently park in the same turnout, the stretch of water downstream of the car will see more pressure than that upstream, and I always want to fish water with less fishing pressure.\nI fish upstream for a few reasons. First, as the name suggests, I fish with dry flies if at all possible, though this is changing a little bit (see below). I think the “float” or presentation of the dry fly is more natural when you cast upstream and let it float back to you, rather than casting downstream and have it float away from you. Maybe this is only because of my own poor technique fishing downstream, but I feel like trying to feed line as a fly floats downstream just looks less natural.\nSecond, fish almost always face upstream into the current. When you approach downstream, the fish are looking away from you and are less likely to spook. This is probably not as big of an issue on larger rivers, but most of my fishing is done on small rivers and creeks where the fish can easily see you if you get too close to their field of vision. A valid counterpoint to this is that if you cast upstream, the fish see the line, leader, and tippet go over their field of vision before they see the fly. If you cast downstream (and the fish face upstream), they see the fly first. This must be true, but I don’t think the fish care much about seeing line in the water, and I think they care a lot about seeing a person moving around. It’s also the case that often when wading you stir up dirt and debris and this can cause off-color water to move downstream. If you’re fishing upstream this is irrelevant because the fish will never know.\nFinally, if a fish takes the fly and you’re downstream of the fish, when you set the fly you are setting it back into the fish’s mouth which produces a better hook set and makes it more likely you land the fish. If you’re fishing downstream, setting the hook pulls the fly away from the fish’s mouth and toward the angler, increasing the chances you’ll simply pull the fly out of the fish’s mouth.\nAlso, it’s harder to net a fish by bringing it upstream to you because you’re fighting the current, which makes it more likely you’ll break your trippet. Easier to bring it downstream toward you.\nThe only exception to my fishing upstream rule is when I use a streamer. My streamer technique is standard and basic: I cast across and down, or just down if the water is narrow, and pull the line back toward me by hand (without reeling in). I almost never fish this way however, because I stink at this technique. I’m sure I’ve caught fewer than five trout on a streamer.\n\n\nCast Short\nThe vast majority of my fishing is done on small and medium size waters. The Logan is the biggest river I normally fish and it has a summer streamflow of around 100 cfs. Compare that a famous western river like the Madison which has a flow over 1,000 cfs above Bozeman. Because of the sizes of my regular waters, I make very short casts, usually shorter than 20 feet, and often closer to ten feet. This is contrary to the idealized image of fly fishing, which is at least partially due to the dramatic fishing shots in A River Runs Through It.\n Casting in the movies.  Casting in real life.\nThe longer your line, the more likely it is you’re going to get something tangled, pile your line on your fly, or just be inaccurate with your cast. To me, there is a direct trade-off between casting accuracy and how much line you’re trying to cast. If you shorten your line, you’re much more likely to put the fly where you want it. And, that’s really the most important thing. I find that if I cast to a spot and make a bad cast, either by presenting the fly poorly, or putting it in the wrong area, I can probably try again and still bring the fish up. But if I do that more than two or three times, the fish will spook and I’ll have lost my chance. The thing that separates really good anglers from average anglers (I am decidedly in the average camp), is that they can make an accurate cast with good presentation to a spot the first time. It might take me two or three or four casts to get the same result, and with each successive catch, the greater the chance the fish will vanish. But even the best casters get less accurate with distance. A friend of mine related a story in which he was trying to make a complicated cast across the water when another friend said, “Are you trying to fish that hole over there? If so, just walk over there and cast into it.” That’s good advice.\n\n\nKeep Moving\nWhen I fished as a kid, and even when I started to learn to fly fish, I would stand in the same spot and cast repeatedly to the same area, sometimes for hours. Looking back, I can’t believe I did this. If a fish didn’t come up for the first fifty casts, why would it come up in the next fifty? As I’ve become better at spotting fish underwater, I also realize that trout will spook after a few casts over their hole. They’ll either move somewhere else, or go to the bottom of their hole and stay there. I’m now a believer in the idea that a hole gets five casts or so, maybe a few more if you’ve got good reason to believe there is a fish in the hole and you haven’t yet spooked it. After that, I move on.\nThe person who taught me to fly fish has an even stricter rule–he makes two or maybe three casts then moves on. I tend to give a spot a little bit more time than that, but not much more. Sometimes if I feel like I haven’t quite hit the spot I’m looking for, and haven’t totally blown the hole by splashing my fly or line all over it, I’ll keep casting into it. But, even five or six casts takes me no more than a minute. After that, I’ll cast to a different spot.\nBy moving, I mean that I wade the river, cast to likely spots a few times, then walk upriver to the next spot. On a river like the Logan, which is full of rocks and holes, I can move only one or two steps laterally or forward to the next spot. On other types of rives that have well-defined holes and riffles, there might be more walking between spots. Either way, I typically cover a lot of water. One of the reasons I get so annoyed with crowded rivers is that it prevents me from moving as much. If I walk upstream and run into another angler, I get out and walk way upriver to get clear of that angler as I don’t want to high-hole them.\n\n\nChange Flies, But Not Too Much\nI believe fly selection is largely overrated, and I think it’s an easy way to signal expertise and purposefully confuse new anglers. Yes, I understand that in some situations there might be a hatch that the fish are keying in on, and if you’re on a super famous river with a ton of pressure it might be really important to match the hatch. But, this is not the average experience. In mid-summer fly fishing on almost any western river, I feel like I basically need a caddis and a parachute adams, maybe in two or three different colors.\nIf your dry fly isn’t working at all, it might be time to switch flies. If this occurs, I always go smaller as I feel like fish will refuse to bite on flies that are too big, but not too small. It’s rare that you need a bigger fly if your existing fly isn’t working. I also switch colors sometimes, basically dividing flies into drab or bright. If drab isn’t working try bright, and vice versa. A lot of people make claims that say on low light days use drab flies (or maybe it’s other way around) but I’ve never noticed any patterns. A lot of this folk wisdom seems to work great except when it doesn’t. Don’t be inimated by fly selection, 90% of my fishing is done with no more than four or five flies. It isn’t a science, and we shouldn’t pretend like it is. Go with what feels right, if it doesn’t work, switch to something different.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "In early 2023, I went with my family to Tequila, Mexico for tequila tasting and sightseeing. I did a lot of research prior to going, mostly on Reddit and other individual blogs, and found they were of some help. I want to detail my experience so others can plan their trip. I can summarize my overall impression by saying, if you’re thinking about doing this, you should; it’s a great trip.\n\nTravel to Guadalajara\nWe flew from Tijuana, Mexico to Guadalajara. My family lives in Southern California and it’s much cheaper to cross into Mexico and fly one of the Mexican domestic carriers than it is to fly from the U.S. For most people, this won’t be possible, but most major U.S. airlines fly to Guadalajara. The Guadalajara airport is nice and fairly large, and it was an easy trip from the airport into the city by taxi for about $20. We bought the taxi ride from a stand inside the airport, as you should always do in Mexico, rather than hailing a taxi from the curb. A few sources online suggested that Uber was not available at the Guadalajara airport, but when I signed on, there were a number of cars available. We used the taxi because the stand was right in the baggage claim area and it just seemed easier.\nWe were concerned about safety before we left, especially because a few days before the Mexican Government arrested the son of El Chapo, and armed conflict broke out between the cartel and the government in Sinaloa, especially in the city of Culiacan. That city is more than 400 miles from Guadalajara, and we never felt unsafe whatsoever during the day. At night we were advised not to walk around our neighborhood, Colonia Americana, so we didn’t venture farther than about four blocks from the hotel in the evening. One night we had dinner at Alcalde, which was pricey but fantastic, and took an Uber there and back even though it was only about one mile each way, within walking distance for us.\nGuadalajara is an interesting and lively city, and it is worth staying a night or two there before heading to Tequila. We stayed three nights and that was probably one night too many. We had plans to see a rodeo, but all sporting events and some other public activities were canceled because of the violence. This was a one-off, unusual event, and not something that happens regularly. All the standard attractions in Guadalajara listed on other travel guides are worth visiting, so I won’t go into details about those here.\n\n\nFrom Guadalajara to Tequila\nAs far as I can tell, the vast majority of American tourists end up day-tripping from Guadalajara to Tequila. I think this is a mistake, as I really liked spending two nights in the town itself. The famous Jose Cuervo Tequila Train only runs on weekends, so we weren’t able to do that. From what I could gather, the train takes people into the town, lets them visit the Cuervo factory, walk around town, then takes them back to Guadalajara. I much preferred having some time to spend in the town itself.\nWe took an Uber from near the center of Guadalajara to Tequila. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes, and cost us $60. Getting back from Tequila to Guadalajara is trickier because there are not a lot of Ubers in Tequila. We ended up hiring a driver through our guide, which cost us $100. There are two other options: hire a taxi in Tequila to Guadalajara, if possible. There are taxis in town, but I’m not sure they’d be willing to drive all the way back or how much it would cost. The other option is the bus which goes from the Tequila bus station, close to the main tourist part of town, and stops at various stations in Guadalajara. The bus leaves every half hour or so all day, and costs only about $10 per person. This was our plan if we were unable to hire a car. The drawback of the bus is that it is slower than a car, and it ends at the central bus station from which you’d have to take an Uber or taxi to your hotel. Also be forewarned: there is often heavy traffic leaving and returning to Guadalajara.\n\n\nIn Tequila\n The town of Tequila, near the main square.\nThe town of Tequila is small and walkable, and felt completely safe. There seemed to be a lot of Mexican tourists drinking and taking tours in buses shaped like tequila barrels, but not many Americans. While there aren’t a ton of sights in the town per se, it’s just a nice place to walk around, hang out, and kill some time. There are distilleries/factories near the downtown area, and a ton of bars and shops; it’s kind of like a tamer version of walking the Vegas strip. If you want to go from shop to shop and bar to bar tasting tequila on the street, you’re in luck. Cantarito is the mixed drink of the moment, and seems to be quite popular among the locals and tourists. It’s made with tequila, citrus juice, and Squirt, and served in a clay cup. I prefer my tequila neat so tasting one cantarito was enough for me.\n “House” tequila in plastic jugs piling up in a bar.\nThere are a few tequila distilleries/factories in town, and we chose the Sauza tour for no other reason than it came recommended on Reddit. Orendain, Cuervo, and potentially others are possibilities. And again, each bar seems to have its own “house” tequila that you can taste. The Sauza tour was fine and we got free tequila drinks at the end. We made a reservation but some of them (maybe Orendain?) don’t require reservations. Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila.\n\n\nVisiting Distilleries Outside Town\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. Most of the guide services I saw only cost roughly $120 per person, though you can reduce individual costs with more people. I liked our guide a lot so please contact me for his information.\n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three.\n\n\nVisiting Logistics\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery.\n\n\nBringing Bottles Back\nThe rules about bringing liquor back into the U.S. are complicated, apparently, and we got stopped at the border after trying to declare our nine bottles. Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings.\n\n\nOutline of Our Trip\n\nThree nights in Guadalajara\n\nStayed at Rame Hotel Boutique\n\nTwo nights in Tequila\n\nStayed at AirBnb\n\nOne night in Tlaquepaque, a suburb of Guadalajara\n\nStayed at La Villa del Ensueno\n\nDistilleries visited\n\nCasa Sauza, in downtown Tequila\nCava del Oro, outside Tequila\nCascahuin, in Arenal outside Tequila\nTres Mujeres, outside Tequila\n\n\nAs I noted above, if one wanted to do this trip in fewer nights, one could do one or two nights in Guadalajara on the front end, two nights in Tequila, then straight back to the airport, or one night back in Guadalajara. I think two nights in Tequila is optimal because that gives you one day to arrive, walk around town and drink tequila, then another day to visit distilleries outside of town, leaving the next day. Everyone in my groups speaks decent Spanish, and we did one tour in Spanish (at Sauza), but it’s easy to find English-speaking guides. Almost everyone we encountered in the service industry in both Tequila and Guadalajara spoke some English.\nBack to Main Page"

As a result, this site is short on pictures but, I hope, long on details. I mostly skip the grip-and-grin fish pictures, and focus on the water and scenery.

Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila."

    "text": "Visiting Other Distilleries\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. \n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three."

    "text": "Visiting Logistics\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery."

Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings."

    "title": "Western Native Trout Challenge",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For whatever reason, I am not as excited for the Western Native Trout Challenge as I am for the state slams. I have been trying to put my finger on why, and I think it has something to do with the idea of becoming fully invested in a state and learning about the different drainages. The WNTC is bigger for sure, but it feels a little more instrumental; it’s kind of like, here’s a list of fish all over the country, go catch them. The best thing about the WNTC challenge is the high quality hat they send you.\nI will also admit that I find the rules incredibly confusing, and I’m wondering whether this sentiment is shared by others. What follows is a wonky discussion, but for those interested, I’ll explain why I think the WNTC rules are flawed. If you don’t care about this, you can skip to the next section.\nThe requirements for the first level, “Expert caster” are simple enough: catch six fish in four different states. After that, things get complicated. To complete the next step, “Advanced caster,” one must catch twelve fish in eight states, though the first six count from the Expert level count. To put it differently, you must repeat the Expert level with different fish species (you submit the fish that you caught for the first level, but you must catch six additional fish and cannot duplicate species for the second level).\nThe problem arises with the limited list of fish provided by each of the states. For example, suppose I wanted to fish in Washington. That state only has three qualifying fish: Redband, Westslope, and Coastal. Each of these fish are native to other states, and in fact I’ve already caught two of these fish for my first level, so I can only use one fish from Washington to advance to the next level of “Advanced caster”.\nNew Mexico only has two fish, one of which is also one of Colorado’s two fish, and the other Colorado fish is the Colorado River cutt, which is on the list for three other states. But, by catching the Colorado River cutt in Utah, I’ve now eliminated Colorado as a state unless I catch the Rio Grande, which in turn eliminates New Mexico as a state. You can catch the same species again and complete the lower “Expert” level for a second time, but it becomes very difficult to plan trips to reach each of the next two steps because one runs out of states pretty quickly. In statistics, we would say there are not enough degrees of freedom to complete each of the three levels without repeating fish (or without going to Alaska).\nI’m betting the challenge was setup this way after bargaining with each state’s Department of Fish and Game, and I imagine each state wants to direct people to certain places and certain fish. But this takes far too much advanced planning and thinking for my taste. What I wish they would have done is made each fish-state combination a possible catch, then just said, to complete the first level catch eight, second is catch 16, third is catch 22 (no pun intended). If one wants to catch a bull trout in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, go for it, that’s three of eight. Or, if an angler wants to catch five in Nevada and three in Utah, that’s enough for the “Expert level”, and reaching the next level requires another eight fish-state combinations. The eight fish requirement would have made the challenge “bigger” than any single state challenge and would have forced people to go to at least two states, and probably more. It also would have simplified things dramatically, and allowed anglers to fish wherever they wanted without having to backward induct where they might be or which fish they might catch in the future.\nTo make this a bit more concrete, I am planning to fish Oregon this summer (2023) and it would be nice to add some fish to complete the next level of the challenge. Here’s the problem. Oregon has five fish on the list, which is a lot, but none of these will help me reach the “Advanced caster” step. I need to catch a bull trout from Nevada for that state’s challenge, so catching one in Oregon doesn’t do anything for me. Same story for the Coastal Cutthroat, which I need for California’s challenge. The other three, Lahontan, Redband, and Westslope, I have already caught in other states and submitted to complete my first challenge level.\nAs a result, I don’t know when, or even if, I will be able to complete the second level of the challenge. It probably won’t be anytime soon, and I’m planning on directing most of my attention to state challenges.\n\nPreviously Caught Fish\nAs noted above, the WNTC requires six fish across four states. A few of the fish I could use from completing my Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada slams, though I needed to submit a slightly different combination of fish given the Challenge’s rules about different fish from different states.\nFrom previous slams, I submitted a Bonneville from the Logan River, Utah, and the Lahontan from Nevada. More details about my Utah and Nevada slams can be found here.\nThat is two fish from two states. The other two obvious states that I’ve fished quite a bit are Idaho and Wyoming. In Wyoming, the qualifying fish are the Bonneville, Colorado River, Westslope and Yellowstone. The Bonneville was out because I used that fish for Utah. The Westslope is also a a qualifying fish in Idaho, and the Yellowstone is a qualifying fish in Nevada and Wyoming. The only distinct fish between Idaho and Wyoming are the bull trout in Idaho, the Redband in Idaho, and the Colorado River in Wyoming. Basically, I’d need some combination of those fish between those two states.\nBecause I’d already caught Colorado River and Yellowstone cutthroats in Wyoming for the Wyoming slam, I now I had four fish from three states. Perhaps surprisingly, I had not caught any qualifying fish in Idaho. Catching any qualifying fish there (that I wasn’t submitting for another state) would give me five fish and four states, and then I could submit any other fish from any state.\n\n\nAborted Attempt to Fish Near Lincoln, MT\nFish number five I caught in the summer of 2019 during a family trip to Lake Coeur d’Alene. I left a few days early and drove through the eastern part of Idaho into Montana, with plans to fish the Lincoln and Ovando, MT areas. From there, I would pick up the 90, and drive to the Idaho panhandle, fishing some rivers there. This did not work as expected, and in fact, the trip went very poorly, right up to the point where it went great.\nI was not in charge of scheduling the stay on Lake Coeur d’Alene and I was worried about my fishing plan because it was still very early in the season, around June 15th. I suspected the larger rivers like the Blackfoot and Clark Fork would still be blown out, and when I got to the area it was clear they were unfishable. Instead, my planned first stop was a forest service campground on a small creek called Copper Creek. The scenery and campground were nice enough but on arrival, I saw that the drainage had semi-recently burned. As a result, there were downed trees all over the creek. It was almost impossible to wade for any period of time, and while I’m sure a more determined angler could have made it work, I gave up pretty quickly. The creek was high, the downfall was bad, and I’d driven all day and it was getting dark.\n Copper Creek, Montana. The deadfall and high water made it almost impossible to fish.\n Looking down on the Copper Creek drainage and toward the Scapegoat Wilderness.\nI spent the night in the campground and had plans the next morning to hike to the Landers Fork, which was about two miles from the trailhead near the campground. Two things happened that prevented this. The first is that I very quickly developed a weird cramp in my foot that made hiking difficult. As I was debating whether or not to turn around and hike back to my car, the second thing happened: I saw a relatively fresh, massive grizzly print on the trail. If ever the universe was giving me a sign, this was it. I turned around, got in my car, and left Copper Creek to continue my drive to Idaho.\n Time to turn around! While the mud around the track was dry, the tracks themselves appeared relatively fresh–maybe a week old, at most.\nI have never seen a grizzly up close in the lower 48. I saw a young black bear from about one hundred yards hiking in the Salt River Range in Wyoming, and I saw a black spot, from maybe a mile away, beelining over a pass (and toward me) in the Gros Ventre Range above Granite Hot Springs, WY. I’m not sure it was a grizzly bear, and I’m not even sure it was a bear at all, but it was big and fast, and didn’t move like an ungulate. Incidentally two years later, in 2021, a grizzly attacked and killed a camper in the town of Ovando, MT.\n The Lincoln Ranger office in Lincoln, MT has a very large grizzly bear on display.\n\n\nCoeur d’Alene River–Westslope Cutthroat\nFrom Montana, I drove straight through to the North Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River, but arrived too late in the day to do much fishing. I stopped at Honeysuckle Campground and was the only person staying there. Things were looking up, until I saw that the fee for the campground was $24 a night! How could it be so expensive when no one was there? And come on, that is outrageous for a national forest service campground. I don’t think I’ve ever paid more than about $16 for one of these campgrounds and I refused to pay it on principle. I resolved the next day to leave the campground and find dispersed camping in the area. I had plans to drive over a ridge and down into the Teepee Creek watershed which eventually flows into the mainstem Coeur d’Alene. I’d read online that fishing was good in Teepee and I’ve always enjoyed fishing smaller waters (online sources refer to it as both “Tepee” and “Teepee”).\nThe fishing was decent on Teepee Creek. I packed up camp, made the short drive over to the creek, and began fishing a meadow near a research station of some kind. The water was a little high, and I didn’t have any success on dry flies, so I switched to a dry dropper setup. I lost one nice fish, then hooked another. Regrettably, I took almost no pictures on this trip for some reason, so in lieu of a Teepee Creek picture, here is one of the fish I caught, a 15 inch Westslope cutthroat.\n My first Westslope cutt from Teepee Creek.\nThings began to warm up and I couldn’t get any more action on Teepee Creek so I made the decision to drive farther down the forest road, which would take me back to the mainstem Couer d’Alene, then back out to the junction where the North Fork and Coeur d’Alene meet, just outside of Caltado, Idaho. The drive up the North Fork to Honeysuckle, then over to Teepee, and back down the mainstem makes a big loop. I needed to get back to civilization anyway to make a phone call, and I still had to find a dispersed camping site. Despite being early in the season, both rivers were at summer flows and I made a few stops to fish along the Coeur d’Alene, but I didn’t have any success.\nIt was crowded, as most holes had a guy or two in them, and there were a lot of people driving the road looking for spots. This suggested to me that the river sees a lot of pressure. It’s big enough, but the water miles alongside the road are somewhat limited so I think the fish in the obvious holes see a lot of flies. There are also lots of other people recreating, swimming in the river, wading, etc., which isn’t necessarily the best for fishing. Despite it being mid-June, it was very hot. In fact, the temperature reached 105, or close to it, in the town of Coeur d’Alene which, needless to say, is not good for the fishing. After a few frustrating hours, a lot of which was spent just trying to find some space on the river, I gave up.\nI started back up the road to Honeysuckle Campground, off the mainstem and onto the North Fork to find a spot to disperse camp. There was a tiny turnoff in the road which didn’t look like much but beneath it, in the trees, was an obvious camping area. I found my free spot at last (take that, Recreation.gov). After setting up camp, I walked down to the river in the evening and fished a little. I didn’t have much success until I came to a small, obvious-looking pool that definitely held fish. I caught a few, tiny trout, though a moose did appear out of the timber on the other side of the river from me. Despite the lack of fishing excitement, that was one of those transcendent experiences that make it all worth while; just me and a moose hanging out by the river in the twilight. Shortly after the moose left, I heard a noise from behind me and expected another moose (or a bear), but it was two other fisherman. I’m not even sure where they came from as the road was up the hill and there weren’t any other campsites around. Was there nowhere on this river where I would have some space to myself? I gave up the hole to them as I wasn’t having much success and went back to my camp.\nThe next morning I was supposed to meet the family in Harrison, on the lake. I was frustrated after the previous day and my plan was to just pack up and leave. I packed up, but made the last minute decision to fish in the morning, and try once again to catch a decent fish in the North Fork Coeur d’Alene. I walked down to the river above a bridge and began wading upstream. I’d tried a lot of different combinations of flies and setups in the previous two days, but because I wasn’t expecting much and was feeling lazy, I had a size 12 or 14 caddis on my line, about the simplest setup imaginable. I pretty quickly caught some small cutts in a shallow section of the river, which encouraged me to wade farther upstream. In a nice looking hole, I made a cast, and a massive fish took the fly. It was more than 15 inches and fought hard. Eventually I landed the fish in my net, and saw that it had another fly with broken line in its mouth. I removed my fly, got the other fly out, and released the fish. I’d actually caught a large Westslope Cutthroat in the North Fork. It was all gravy from there, and I waded upstream and caught more large fish. That turned out to be one of my best days of fishing ever.\nIs the Coeur d’Alene a good trout river? I think so? I didn’t have any success for about the first ten hours I fished (yes, I hooked two cutts in Teepee Creek), but the last four or so were magical. I’m not sure what changed, other than my fly. It is crowded, and I don’t like crowds, but clearly if you can find the right spots with the right fly, there are some fish worth catching. And, after all that, the Idaho Westslope gave me five fish from four states.\n\n\nBig Wood River–Redband Trout\nI had no idea that redband trout are a form of rainbow trout, until I read it on the Idaho Fish and Game websie. A lot of people, it seems, are confused by this based on what I’ve read in other fly fishing forums. Here’s what the IFG says, “All rainbow trout native to streams east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington are called redband trout.” This would be my last fish necessary for to complete the first level of the WNTC, and I had a plan to fish for it on the Big Wood River in Ketchum, Idaho.\nI’m in the Ketchum/Sun Valley area often enough, and it’s one of my favorite mountain towns. There are a lot of outdoor activites, it’s beautiful, especially in the fall, and the Big Wood flows right through town. There is only one problem: I’ve never actually had much success on the Big Wood. A few times I’ve been to Ketchum, my timing has been bad. One year it was still too high to fish and my attempt to wade it nearly resulted in me getting swept downstream into the Snake. Most other times I’ve been to Ketchum I’ve been with other people who don’t want to fish and have only limited patience for watching me fish. I finally got my chance to really fish it in the summer of 2020 when we took advantage of remote work to spend a week at an Airbnb in Hailey. There would be no dining out or hitting the town, but I would have a chance to spend some time on the Big Wood.\nThe unfortunate part of the Big Wood is that it is crowded. That’s to be expected given that it flows through a series of famous mountain towns, and there are fly shops in Ketchum that provide guide services. But still, the first day I tried to fish it in 2020, I didn’t have to wade that far upriver until I ran into another group coming down. I turned around to go back, and there was yet another group behind me. I’ve had more success driving upstream or downstream of town rather than trying to fish in Ketchum itself.\nIn fact, the first redband trout I caught was in Hailey, near where I was staying. It was mid-July, and the water was still a little high, but wadeable. It was clear nothing was happening on the surface, so I used both a dry dropper and a tight-line nymph setup to catch fish. Both worked relatively well. Later in the trip I went upstream and managed to catch one or two fish on a dry, though I was using a dropper as well, and that seemed to work better.\nThat experience on the Big Wood was very serviceable. The fishing was steady though not spectacular, I didn’t catch any fish over about 12 inches, nor did I have much action on drys. Still, the Big Wood is a pretty easy river to figure out. Staying in Ketchum or Hailey and spending a few days fishing the Big Wood, and some nearby creeks (e.g., Trail Creek), is a pleasant experience. Just don’t expect to be alone on the water.\n\n\nOther Fish\nWith the Redband from the Big Wood, I had my six fish from four states. Even though I’d previously caught a Yellowstone and Colorado River cutt for the Wyoming slam, I actually submitted two different fish from my slam fish, just for fun. I caught a Colorado River cutthroat from the very top of LaBarge Creek in the Tri-Basin divide. The creek here is very small, but I managed to bring up a few fish. Most people are going to want to fish it farther downstream where the creek is larger, however.\nI also submitted a Yellowstone from South Leigh Creek, outside of Driggs, Idaho. There are a number of small creeks flowing off the western side of the Teton Range, and I picked South Leigh because it was closest to where I was staying. I believe Bitch Creek to be the most famous fishing water of these creeks, and I have backpacked, but not fished, in that drainage. I believe Teton Creek, Badger Creek, North Leigh Creek, and others are also possibilities, but I haven’t fished any of these either. My impression is they are all pretty small and might make for a nice small-water experience, but aren’t going to provide great fishing. Keep in mind that while you’re on the west side of the Tetons and the towns themselves are located in Idaho, almost all the public lands where you can fish are in Wyoming.\n Grand Tetons from Driggs, Idaho area.\n\n\nSubmitted Fish\nHere are the fish I submitted for the “Expert” level of the WNTC and where I caught them.\n\nBonneville Cutt\n\nLogan River, UT\n\nColorado River Cutt\n\nLaBarge Creek, WY\n\nWestslope Cutt\n\nTeepee Creek, ID\n\nYellowstone Cutt\n\nS.

    "title": "Attending Oktoberfest, Munich Germany",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I went to Munich for Oktoberfest in 2022, the first year the event was held since the pandemic. A number of my friends had been and encouraged me to go, with one of them saying something like, “it’s the most fun I’ve ever had.” My overall verdict is not quite as enthusiastic. I thought it was mostly fun, though it wasn’t the life-changing experience I was hoping it would be.\nA number of things worked against me. First, I got sick three days into a five day trip. I don’t think it was COVID as I took a few tests which were all negative, but one of my friends tested positive when he arrived back in the states. I will say that if you are at all concerned about getting COVID, Oktoberfest is not the place for you. The tents are fully enclosed with tens of thousands of people drinking, singing, and yelling, and the bathrooms are crowded and not well ventilated. I was told after leaving that the “Wiesen-flu” is a common sickness around Germany after Oktoberfest ends. I’m guessing that’s what I got, and though I felt better enough to leave my AirBnB after about a day and a half of sickness, it took me weeks to shake the congestion.\nBesides being stuck in a hotel room for about a day and half during my trip, it was rainy and cold the entire time. This means the outdoor beer gardens at both the tents and within the city were all closed. This also probably made things more crowded inside and at times, it was difficult to find room in the tents (more on that below). Finally, our AirBnB was not nice, which is a thing that happens sometimes and there isn’t much to do about it. Rates in hotels and AirBnBs for Oktoberfest are pricey, and we tried to squeeze five or six people into three bedrooms, with limited success.\n\nTravel to and Around Munich\nIt’s easy enough to fly from the states to Munich, and once one arrives, there is a train that goes straight into the city after about a half hour ride. I suppose one could take an Uber or taxi, but there’s almost no reason to do that as the train is cheap and straightforward. Make sure you buy a ticket though because the police checked on the train I was on and wrote two women a ticket.\nOnce in Munich, there is a bus and streetcar system that is kind of navigable to non-German speakers. It took us a few attempts to figure out how to buy tickets as there weren’t any machines at most of the streetcar stations, but you can buy them from the drivers. This requires having the right Euro denominations, however.\nI mostly used the city bike and scooter shares, and walked. Annoyingly, the bike share requires an app that is easiest to setup before you leave and can be found here. Another word of caution. My friend and I tried to use scooters after leaving Oktoberfest one night when the police approached us and warned us that we weren’t allowed to bike or scooter after drinking. They were exceedingly nice about it, but told us that doing so is the equivalent of driving a car drunk (which is, of course, complete absurd). Another night I rode a bike home and no one stopped me, but apparently that was risky.\n\n\nOktoberfest Grounds\nWithin the Oktoberfest grounds, there are rides, food, tents, and gift shops. The food, both at the stands and in the tents, was shockingly good. The tents are mostly chicken and sausage, priced at roughly what they would be in the states. Outside at the stands, there was a greater variety and was perhaps a bit cheaper than in the tents. The rides are carnival rides basically, and I wasn’t interested because of how cold and rainy it was.\nThe tents and grounds are more crowded at night, obviously, but surprisingly, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. We saw only one fight our entire Oktoberfest trip, not involving Americans, thank god.\n\n\nThe Tents\nThere are something like twelve different main tents, and I probably walked through about eight of them. The vibe inside each of them was shockingly different–one tent seemed to have more Germans, while another tent seemed to have no one over the age of about 20 in it. They all have different looks and decorations, though all of them have a band and band leaders and they all seemed to basically play the same songs. It was a mix of pop singalong favorites (think Abba, YMCA, Take Me Home Country Roads, Sweet Caroline) and German songs, especially the “Ziggy Zaggy, Ziggy Zaggy, Oi Oi” song. For some reason, “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus, which I hadn’t heard in 15 years, is really popular. The music, especially the pop music, gets kind of old after awhile as it seems pitched at the Boomer/Gen-X karoake demographic. The beer mostly tastes the same though I had a weak preference for some of the beers over others.\nHow wild were things inside the tents? It kind of depended on the tent, but moderately wild, especially at night. After about 7 p.m. everyone has had a lot to drink so most people are just drinking and talking. As alluded to above, everyone is pretty well behaved and security is present but not exactly like at an American club. I saw one person throwing up everywhere and security eventually saw him and gently escorted him out. I saw a handful of people doing drugs and they weren’t exactly being that surreptitious about it. I didn’t see any fights except the one I mentioned outside a tent. In some of the tents, people stand on the benches rather than sit at the table, but occassionally a bench goes over and people go everywhere.\n\n\nDo You Need Reservations?\nYes, it would be helpful, but reservations are not strictly necessary and it isn’t that easy for non-Germans to make reservations. It seems to depend on the tent, the day, and the time. Our experience was that reservations were not needed anywhere during the day as things were pretty open, especially on Thursday and Friday. At night, things were more crowded, and reservations were required in some of the tents we visited. In others, the servers were willing to squeeze you in if there was room at a table, though in most of the tents you could also squeeze into the walkways, though this is a bit claustrophobic and uncomfortable.\nOur experience was as follows. The first tent we went to was on Thursday afternoon and it wasn’t very crowded. We were able to sit down and we ordered food and beers. At about 4 p.m., the server kicked us out of our table so they could begin preparing for the evening shift, for which all tables were reserved.\nAfter that, we walked into another tent, couldn’t find any space, walked into a third tent, and decided we needed to be more aggressive about making space. My group split up, and myself and two of my friends were able to make space in a walkway rather than at a table. This made it a little tricky to get beer, though with a little persistence we were able to. I think the key thing for Americans to remember is that personal space and beer service are not as regimented as in the U.S. If you see a plausible place to stand, occupy that space until someone makes you move. If you see a server walking by with beer, wave them down. It’s a little bit more of a free-for-all as compared to American restaurants or bars.\nThe next night, Friday night, was much more crowded, but we were able to get a table in a tent in the early afternoon. This particular tent did not make us leave and we held that table until closing (which is early, about 10 p.m.) The server did try to squeeze other people in at our table, and if your party wasn’t large enough, other people were going to be put at your table.\nThe reality is, even if you want to make a reservation it’s likely not going to be possible. Figuring out the websites prior to leaving the States seemed almost impossible. Those sites that I could figure out required significant deposits for both beer and food (something like $150 a person, with a minimum on the number of people) that I wasn’t willing to shell out before getting to Germany.\nIn sum, though I think reservations would have helped, especially the first night, it wasn’t easy to make them and we were able to survive without them. It’s important to get to a tent before things get crowded in the early evening. If you get kicked out of your table at 4 p.m., move quickly to another tent to get a table for the evening. If you’ve got a table at around 5, don’t leave it unless you’re ready to go home.\n\n\nWould I Go Back?\nI’ve thought about this question a lot, and I think the answer is yes, especially if I knew other people who were going. In retrospect, I had a lot of bad luck that diminished my fun. Getting sick halfway through the trip meant I didn’t actually get all that much time at Oktoberfest. The weather definitely didn’t help things either.\nIf you can’t go during Oktoberfest, one could have a similar experience just by going to the beer halls in downtown Munich. In fact, we did that the first night and it may have been my favorite overall experience. Many of the breweries have their own halls near Marienplatz and it’s easy to walk between them. The beer is the same, the food is probably better, and there are Bavarian bands and lots of other people hanging out.\nOne final thing: wear lederhosen or a dirndl at Oktoberfest. Almost everyone wears it, and it makes the experience more fun and festive. I read some stuff online that said not to buy cheap or knock-off clothes because the Germans will be annoyed, but I really doubt anyone would notice. I bought some lederhosen but my friends rented from this place, which was a good option.\nHey baby won’t you be my girl reference\ncash only"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Even after completing the O, I’m still struggling to process the hike. Every influencer website I’ve seen has a title like, “OMG, 15 reasons why you must hike the O!” This is not going to be one of those posts. The O trek has some real problems, and I’m still not sure I actually enjoyed it. Some of these were the result of bad luck (the weather), but some of the issues I encountered are systematic, and are the same issues encountered by everyone who undertakes it. I asked another hiker on the trek, who was older and more philosophical than me, whether he would recommend the hike to others. He said he’d thought about the question a lot because he had friends back in the States who were backpackers and would want to know how it was. His response was something like, “I’ll tell them what my experience was, avoid trying to frame it either way, and let them decide for themselves.” I think that’s a good answer, so here goes.\n\nThe Good\nThe scenery, from what I could see, is incredible. The trail is all killer, no filler, with day after day of views. There are no long approaches through trees, no trudging for a day to get to the good stuff, no boring terrain. Every day is spectacular. I’d done a lot of research before the trip and was honestly worried I’d be underwhelmed by the views; I wasn’t. The diversity of the views is amazing too, as the hike traverses forests, deserts, alpine areas, glaciers, river valleys, and cliffs. Many of the mountain scenes don’t even look real, appearing more like computer generated special effects for a movie. At times, I thought the good stuff would be over; it never was. This is one of the world’s most famous hikes for a reason, and the views didn’t disappoint.\nIt’s a good option for people who want to ease into longer, multi-day hikes. It’s in a foreign country with a different language, which makes things a little trickier, but there are a lot of resources for completing it, and the physical aspect is not that demanding. There is plenty of support if things go wrong, there are no animals to worry about, no chance of losing the trail, and lots of people to keep one company. The scenery/difficulty tradeoff is really high, meaning that hikers really get a lot of bang for their walking miles. The refugio system also provides food and shelter, which means substantially less weight for people who don’t want to carry much.\n\n\nThe Bad\nThe list is long, but each of these things are arguably less important than the actual hike itself. The cost is high, the logistics are annoying, the trail itself is a complete disaster, it’s crowded, and the camping/refugio/park bureaucracy is hard to deal with.\nThe weather deserves a special mention here as it nearly ruined our trip, but this isn’t constant across hikers like the other things I mentioned. In other words, a hiker could luck out, get great weather and see everything, or one could have rain every day, which makes the experience much worse.\nThe biggest problem with the rain is that it obscured many of our views. We saw almost nothing of the Rio Paine River valley, the area around Dickson, or the Frances-Britanico canyon. Of our seven days on the trail, views on two of them were completely blocked by rain, two more days had mostly obscured views for much of the day, and only three days had relatively good views. It was very frustrating to spend days traveling to the park, months planning, and thousands of dollars to arrive and see only the bottom third of the mountain. This is perhaps my biggest hesitation in recommending the trip to others. Of course, one cannot plan for the weather, and this was just uncommonly bad luck, but the bad weather in Patagonia certainly weighs negatively on the scale of whether to hike the O.\n\n\nThe Ugly\nThe refugios and the entire system surrounding them is a complete and utter disaster. Two private companies, Vertice and Fantastico Sur (also called Las Torres), manage all the refugios in the park. The CEOs of both should be jailed for crimes against humanity. There are clearly too many people at each refugio so everything was crowded. The food was disgusting, the costs exorbitant, and the outward contempt for hikers displayed by both the companies and their staff, from start to finish, is overwhelming. The Chilean government should burn the entire refugio system down (metaphorically) and start over.\n\n\nTopics\n\nLogistics of travel to and from the park\nOverview of our hike, including mileage, times, and descriptions\nProblems with the O\nThe Refugio System\nImpressions of Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales\nMt.

    "title": "Summary of Our Six Night, Seven Day Hike",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike most hikers, we planned to do the hike in six days. We didn’t meet a single other person who had this schedule, so I’ll detail the normal schedule, then what we did. The Caltopo mileage map of our hike is here: O in Six Nights. Note that all information described here reflects my experience in February 2023, but may change–all information should be independently verified.\nMost hikers completing the O move from refugio to refugio on the back side. There are more choices on the front side (the part that overlaps with the W), so there things are a little bit more flexible. For our purposes, moving counter-clockwise with the direction of the hike, the back side consists of the refugios of Seron, Dickson, and Los Perros, while the front side (also the W side), consists of Grey, Paine Grande, Frances, and Cuernos. The refugios are a cluster of buildings consisting of a lobby/eating area, a cooking area, a hostel-style dormitory, a minimarket with varying quantity and quality of food, and a designated camping area. All hikers must camp or stay at the refugios–unlike in the U.S., there is no camping where you choose.\nRefugios (moving counter-clockwise)\n\nCentro (park entrance, mile 0)\nSeron (first refugio from the park entrance, mile 8.27 from Centro excluding hike up to Mirador Base Las Torres)\nDickson (all hikers completing the O must have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros; most have reservations at both, mile 19.29 from Centro)\nLos Perros (all hikers must leave Los Perros by 7am to start over the pass, mile 26.62 from Centro)\nGrey (mile 35.65 from Centro)\nPaine Grande (mile 42.18 from Centro)\nFrances (mile 55.7 from Centro, including hike to Frances, bag drop, up to miradores, back to Frances)\nCuernos (Frances and Cuernos are close to each other and interchangeable for the last night’s stay, mile 57.9 from Centro)\n\nCONAF, the Chilean national forest bureaucracy, manages the park. The refugio system is meant to protect the park, but also manage the visitors. In particular, the Los Perros refugio is essentially used as a staging area for hikers to get over the pass. Thus, the main requirement of the refugio system is that hikers spend the night at Los Perros so they can begin trekking over the pass from Los Perros at 7am. The CONAF rangers close the trail after 7am as the pass is much safer and less windy early in the day, apparently. (I believe this requirement is in place all summer as there were signs along the trail informing hikers of the 7am start time, but I’ve also read in other places that when the weather is better the 7am cutoff does not exist.)\nFrom this requirement, everything flows backwards. Most visitors hike from Centro to Seron, Seron to Dickson, and Dickson to Los Perros so they can be in position to begin the hike over the pass at 7 am. A few miles after Seron, there is a ranger station where the ranger on duty checks reservations to ensure that hikers have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros. If a hiker does not, they will not let them proceed to the back side of the O. Note, however, that there was no requirement you have reservations at both Dickson and Los Perros (as of February 2023). Technically, it seems like one could camp at Dickson then make it to Los Perros before 7am to cross the pass. That doesn’t make sense though, and it’s much easier to skip Dickson and hike directly from Seron to Los Perros, which seemed to be allowed by the park system, though not by the reservation system (more details on that in the discussion of the refugio section). Also important to note is that you must make Dickson by 2pm to continue to Los Perros. There is a ranger station at Dickson and they close the trail at 2.\nAfter Los Perros, visitors hike from refugios Los Perros to Grey, Grey to Paine Grande, Paine Grande to either Frances or Cuernos (they are within two miles of each other), then out back to Centro, taking a total of seven nights. We took six nights by hiking from Seron to Los Perros, skipping Dickson. Our logic was that the hike from Dickson to Los Perros is listed by most sources as only five miles, though according to Caltopo, it’s closer to 7.5. When we told other hikers we had done this, many of them didn’t even realize it’s allowed. Once you’re over the pass, after Los Perros, anything goes. One could conceivably hike from Grey to Frances/Cuernos without too much trouble, skipping Paine Grande, then out to Centro.\nI think the minimum number of nights to complete the trek would be as follows: stay at Centro and hike to Las Torres, Centro to Seron, Seron to Los Perros, Los Perros to Paine Grande, Paine Grande to Centro. This would be only four nights, including a night at Centro to complete Base Las Torres, and would require some super human effort as the mileage doesn’t tell the whole story, so I DO NOT recommend it, but for extremely fit hikers, it seems doable. The hike from Grey to Paine Grande is short and easy, as is the hike from Paine Grande to either Frances or Cuernos. The hike from either of those two back to Centro is not particularly short (about 10 miles), but is relatively easy.\nThe problem is, the hike from Seron to Los Perros is not easy, nor is the hike from Los Perros to Grey, despite relatively short mileage. We skipped Dickson because it didn’t make sense to us to have a day that was only seven miles (Dickson to Los Perros), but this hike turned out to be much tougher than we expected because of the rain, the mud, and the structure of the trail. Again, most hikers will want to complete the hike in the normal seven nights. Very fit hikers can complete the trek in six nights, while attempting it in any fewer nights should be left to those who can easily do 20+ mile days (again, the mileage on the O doesn’t tell the whole story, for reasons described below).\n\nHiking Days\nSummary of our hiking days, with mileage taken from Caltopo, not from any official trail maps or online publications. Distances given on the infrequent signs on the trail are obviously wrong, so you should ignore them. Time is hours to complete, excluding breaks, though this measure is imperfect and will vary based on conditions.\n\nDay 1: Arrive at park, camp at Centro, hike Base Las Torres and back. 11.78 miles, 3467 ft. total elevation gain, 5.5 hours.\nWe took a bus that left Puerto Natales at 6:45am and arrived at the park about two hours later, around 8:45. After accomplishing the rigmorole with entering the park and catching the shuttle bus, we walked over to the Centro campsite as we wanted to drop our packs there, and perhaps even reserve our site. It was only about 9:30 am, but they let us check in and instructed us to find a spot without a tent. Unlike U.S. park campsites, there are no designated spots, just an area where you can setup anywhere. We put up our tent to claim our spot and started hiking from there up to Base Las Torres.\nMany hikers save the Base Las Torres hike for the end, and hike only to Seron the first day. I prefer our method because it seemed to shorten the trip a little, and we didn’t have to fight the crowds at the end of the hike after we were tired. In terms of hiking difficulty, the stats suggest this is the second most difficult day, though you’re not carrying a backpack. This is the most popular day hike in the park because it basically leaves from the Welcome Center. The trail is crowded with day hikers and we struggled to fight through a lot of slow hikers, many of whom refused to give way to faster hikers.\n Looking up Windy Pass.\nFrom the Welcome Center the trail meanders down the park road until it reaches the Hotel. From there, it’s basically flat until it begins climbing steeply after a bridge. The trail gains a lot of elevation very quickly until reaching Paso del Viento, which provides nice views up the valley and back across the plain. From here, the trail goes downhill to the Chileno refugio, then flattens out a bit, then climbs again steeply. After climbing, the last push to the Las Torres bowl begins, and eventually hikers come out of the trees and begin a steep rocky ascent up a drainage, then cut across the face of the slope until emerging in the bowl at Lago Torres. It’s this last section where the hiking conga-line gets really bad as the trail is steep, narrow, and slow.\n Crowds heading up the last push toward Base Las Torres.\nIt’s important to begin this hike as early as possible as the weather seems to deteriorate in the afternoon. Even though we took the 6:45am bus, we weren’t able to start hiking until about 10am after taking the shuttle bus, getting the campsite, setting up our tent, etc. By the time we were nearly down, about 3pm, it had started raining near the towers. It’s also important to note that the rangers close the trail to the towers at Chileno after 2pm, and at 4pm, they apparently make everyone start descending.\n\n\nDay 2: Centro to Seron. 8.27 miles, 1132 ft. total elevation gain, 3 hours.\nThis is one of the easier hikes on the Circuit. From Centro, the trail steeply climbs some hilly terrain and is a bit up and down for a few miles, eventually dropping into the Rio Paine Grande river basin. It’s obvious when this occurs and if you look closely down into the basin you can see the refugio across a flat meadow that’s a quick hike. The views to the left of the mountains are good (from what I could see), and once you reach the ridge looking down into the valley you get a preview of the next day’s hike. We weren’t able to see all that much as storms rolled in intermittently throughout the day. At the time, the weather was annoying, though this was only a preview of what was to come.\n\n\nDay 3: Seron to Los Perros. 18.35 miles, 3197 ft. total elevation gain, 8 hours.\nAfter the Seron refugio, the trail climbs into some hills bordering the river, which will be on the right. The trail is a bit up and down here, though mostly up and sometimes quite steeply. Until you are definitively headed west rather than north (for about 2.5 miles), you have not turned the corner and will not start heading down. In this area, there is also a sign that hikers should not proceed without a reservation at either Dickson or Los Perros. Lago Paine will be on the right, and the views from the walk along the top of this hill, looking down at the lake and up the Rio Paine Valley are fantastic. From the top, it’s a pretty easy, though windy, hike across the face of the mountains. The trail drops down into the trees and the ranger check station, to ensure hikers have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros, is located here. This is probably five or six miles from Seron.\nThe ranger described the subsequent five or six miles as flat, but it’s more like gently rolling. Still, the hiking is easy and the views get better and better as one approaches Dickson. For us, these last five or six miles to Dickson were the worst on the entire trip because it was absolutely pouring rain and we couldn’t see more than two hundred feet off the valley floor. But, I think the views would have been really good. There is a sign somewhere near the wetland that says Dickson is something like 2 km, but it felt more like 4. The trail climbs a large hill, and upon summitting, you can see Dickson down below. It looks like the trail nearly falls off a cliff, but it’s a steep, short hike down.\n This was typical of our views on the way to Dickson because of the rain.\nMost hikers will stop here and spend the night, and we did the approximately 11.5 mile hike to Dickson in a quick four hours, but we were really moving because of the rain. Despite the elevation gain at the beginning, this is a pretty easy hike. The difficulty we had was from Dickson to Los Perros. The trail immediately begins climbing after Dickson and doesn’t stop until Seron. It was complete slop at this point, both from the rain and the previous group of hikers who left from Dickson in the morning. Despite our research and maps telling us this hike is only about five miles, Caltopo suggests it’s more like seven. It took us another four hours to go seven miles, even after we’d just gone more than 11 miles in four hours.\nWe stopped at Dickson for about an hour to try and dry out, and this was really the low point of the trip for me. I was soaking wet, I knew I had another five or more miles ahead of me, it was still pouring rain and all the views were obscured. Luckily, while we tried to warm up at Dickson, the rain broke just enough so that we were mostly hiking through showers and spritzes the rest of the day, rather than the outright downpour that occurred on the walk to Dickson. We could even see some mountain peaks once we gained elevation after Dickson, and I imagine if it was clear, the scenery would be incredible, reminiscent of the Alps.\n The clouds lifted just enough to give us views like this on the trail between Dickson and Los Perros.\nAfter the initial climb out of Dickson, the trail flattens out a bit, then turns the corner on the drainage and begins another steep climb. The mud here was challenging. A sign indicates the Los Perros refugio was only 2km, but there is no way this is accurate. The trail keeps climbing and everytime you think you’re going to top out and arrive, the trail finds more elevation. Eventually, you can see the side of a bowl in front of you, and the trail climbs through the trees into the bowl, which is Laguna Los Perros and Glacier Los Perros. The view of the lake and glacier is incredible, but it was late in the day for us, the wind was howling, we were soaking wet, and it was still drizzling, so we kept walking. I have no photos of the lake or the glacier, which is unfortunate, but I was in absolutely no mood at the time to stop and get my camera out of my pack. The trail goes up a little more from here, then descends into a small creek drainage, and the refugio is on the left amongst some trees.\nThe hike was hard in terms of miles and distance, but very doable for hikers with above average fitness, though the mud does not discriminate. On a nice day, I think it would be very pleasant and relatively straighforward, and of course, that was our thought when we planned the trip and decided to skip Dickson. While the scenery around Dickson looked nice, in my opinion the hikes from Seron to Dickson, and then from Dickson to Los Perros, are too easy to justify two separate days. That assumes, of course, that you aren’t hiking in the rain and the mud for nearly eight hours. In retrospect, I’m still glad we didn’t spend two days completing this section of the hike, but it was pretty miserable given the weather.\n\n\nDay 3: Los Perros to Grey. 9.03 miles, 2816 ft. total elevation gain, 7.5 hours.\nThe wind absolutely howled all night (when didn’t it?) at Los Perros, and we could hear rain showers smacking our tent. I was legitimately nervous about how the hike over the pass would go. It turned out that I was right to be nervous, as I later learned that the day before, when we were hiking in the rain near Dickson, hikers were crossing the pass in a blinding snow storm. Word around the camp the previous day at Seron was that a big storm was coming in, and I asked one of the workers at the refugio to check the weather and if he thought we’d be able to get over the pass. He told us that the weather looked bad, and it would be a rough hike, both of which he was correct about. He also said that the rangers coordinate with the refugios about weather over the pass, and that it is possible they would close the pass. In that case, hikers would be held at each refugio down the line, though it must take awfully bad weather for the rangers to close the pass.\nLuckily for us, despite the bad weather overnight, things cleared for our pass day. It really wasn’t all that cold either. When you stop at Los Perros, you are required to check-in at the ranger station. They warn you about the pass, advise you to leave Los Perros as soon as is feasible, around 6:30am when it begins to get light (in late February), and to follow other groups. The trail itself is also well-marked with orange paint, poles, and blazes, but in a blizzard it might be easy to lose your way (as I later learned).\nThe trail to the top of the pass is steep, but relatively short. It’s mostly through small trees at the start, which provides some protection from the wind, but annoyingly, it sometimes loses elevation for no good reason. Once the trail emerges out of the trees, it’s pretty much straight up some rocky slopes with a few small creek crossings. The views are nearly indescribable. There is a large glacier on hiker’s right that is at and above your elevation, views down canyon to the peaks below, and craggy mountain peaks above and to the left. This area is really where some switchbacks would be useful as the trail ascends nearly straight up the rocks to small flat areas, then heads up again.\n From near the top of Paso John Garner looking back to Lago Los Perros.\nThe hike to the pass is only a little more than two miles, and it took us less than three hours total. The initial descent from the pass descends the rocky saddle and you can’t see much of Grey Glacier until it gets steeper. It’s also (of course) very windy. After the initial descent, the trail cuts to the left and Grey glacier comes closer into view. It’s hard to describe the view of the mountains, the glacier, which is much farther below you, and how it appears up and down valley. Unfortunately, the steepness and muddiness of the trail made for a pretty miserable descent, as it was almost impossible not to slip and fall here. The going was really slow and eventually hikers arrive at Camp Paso, with another ranger check-in. The ranger asked me how we were doing, and said there were two meters of snow on the pass the day before, which I found just incredible as there was almost no snow when we ascended. When I asked what happened to all the snow, he shrugged and said, “se va,” it goes. As an aside, I found that with a little bit of Spanish, all the rangers loved chatting hikers up and asking if they were enjoying themselves.\n Once over the pass, the views of Grey Glacier are amazing.\nI also made the mistake of asking the ranger how far it was to Grey refugio. I thought it was about 2.5 more miles, and he said it was 10.5 km, or about 6.5 miles. This simply seemed impossible as we’d spent nearly six hours hiking from Los Perros. How had we only gone three miles or so, especially after reaching the top of the pass in a such a short time? The descent from the pass was that bad. Once you arrive at the ranger station, the difficult descent is mostly done, though the trail here is really up and down and still somewhat muddy. The famous suspension bridges are in this area, and I’m glad we didn’t have to do them in strong winds. I couldn’t enjoy them as much as I wanted because I was ready to be done with the hike.\n Steep and muddy all the way down.\nWe arrived at Grey around 3pm, which means we hiked for about eight hours and fifteen minutes, covering only nine miles. This was the first day I truly felt tired after the hike, and I thought that despite the short distance, it was by far the most difficult day. I spoke to other hikers at the refugio, and they confirmed that the hike was more difficult than they had imagined. And, surprisingly, it wasn’t the hike up to the pass, but down from the pass that was hard. In terms of day difficulties, this ranked first, with the previous day, more than 18 miles from Seron to Los Perros, a distant second. It was just impossible to move with any kind of urgency descending from the pass in the mud, then hiking another six miles or so constantly going up and down.\nA few days later, I spoke to another hiker who had climbed the pass the day before us. I still found the ranger’s statement about there being two meters of snow on the pass unbelievable, but my hiker friend said he summitted the pass in a blizzard. All the warnings the rangers had given us at Seron actually applied to him as he said he couldn’t see a thing, it was snowing hard, and the wind was sideways. Part of his thumb was still numb from the experience. This strikes me as unusual, but given the rain and cold we had down low, it isn’t hard for me to imagine how bad the pass could have been. He also said a ranger was ascending the other side of the pass as he was coming down, checking on people, making sure they were okay, and helping guide them down. I don’t think the CONAF rangers play fast and loose with people’s safety on the pass, and I do think they check conditions regularly, but it also seems like they want to keep the line moving. For the vast majority of hikers, this will never be an issue, but bad luck does strike, and those hikers were in a difficult situation.\n\n\nDay 4: Grey to Paine Grande. 6.53 miles, 1221 ft. total elevation gain, 3 hours.\nAn easy day, and boy did we need it after the previous two. This was our second day of good weather and the hiking was crisp. After the steep descent from the pass, the trail more slowly descends toward the lake and glacier, before and after Greys. The views are really spectacular, and you get different perspectives of the glacier by starting way above it, then closer to it, then moving past it and looking back on it. This day was so clear, we could see more of the mountains on the other side of Lago Grey. This was perhaps my favorite day of the hike.\nFrom Grey, the trail is mostly flat (at least relatively to the previous day) until it climbs steeply but shortly up to a small little drainage on the side of a cliff. There is some minor exposure here, as there was on the previous day. I don’t like exposure at all, but this was really minimal, though not nothing. I think for most people, the suspension bridges will be a little scarier than the exposure. It’s repetitive to talk about the views again, so I’ll just say they were indescribable, with the lake, the mountains, and the glacier in the distance. Just when you’re cursing the trail, the weather, the government of Chile, other hikers, the people you’re with, the refugios, and basically anything else you can think of, the O delivers a day like this.\n What a view, between Grey and Paine Grande.\nEventually the trail descends steeply down a canyon and O hikers meet more and more W hikers coming up from Paine Grande. At the end of the canyon, on Lago Pehoe, is the Paine Grande refugio. Paine Grande, the peak, along with the Cuernos, tower over the refugio. Unfortunately, the refugio is located at the exact base of the canyon for maximum wind exposure, though that’s the least of this refugio’s problems. I’m glad we had some time here because we finished hiking early and the views up to the peaks are spectacular, as are the views looking across the lake.\n\n\nDay 5: Paine Grande to Frances, including Mirador Britanico. 13.52 miles, 3512 ft. total elevation gain. We completed only about eight miles of this, in about 3 hours. The time is difficult to determine because we waited at various points to see if the weather would clear.\nWe’d had two days of nice weather so it was inevitable our luck would run out. While we started the day from Grey to Paine Grande in bright sunshine, by that night it had clouded up completely and it was clear another storm was moving in. It started raining that night quite hard, and we awoke in the morning to intermittent, but heavy showers. The forecast as posted in the refugio suggested it would clear up, but unfortunately it never did.\n The Paine Grande refugio has its issues, but the view can’t be beat.\nOur original plan was to hike from Paine Grande to Italiano, which is not a proper refugio but two buildings with some shelter. I don’t think there is much else there, but I’m not entirely sure about that. From there, the trail splits, with one direction of it going up into the canyon to provide views of the Frances glacier and the Cuernos, and the other going to Frances refugio. Shortly after Frances, about two more miles, is Cuernos refugio. Our original plan was to drop our packs at Italiano, hike up to the overlooks, then back down, grab our packs and continue the mile or so to Frances. We’d originally wanted to camp at Cuernos as it was closer to our exit the next day, but it was fully booked so we were stuck at Frances, in one of the “fancy” canvas tents.\nThe hike from Paine Grande to Italiano is easy. Immediately out of Paine Grande refugio, there is a short and easy climb, then it is mostly small, rolling terrain, passing by a small lake and descending slightly toward Italiano. These four and a half miles or so took us only about two hours, though we left later in the morning because we were trying to wait out the weather. That didn’t work, and we hiked a lot of this in rain, though it wasn’t as bad as the rain to Dickson.\nEven before you arrive at Italiano, you can see up-valley enough to get glimpses of Frances glacier. Unfortunately, it was raining harder on the mountains and glacier, and they were totally socked-in. We decided to continue hiking to Frances refugio, drop our packs, shelter in the tent, and hopefully wait the storm out, before back-tracking to Italiano to hike up to the miradores, hopefully in better weather. It’s an initial uphill from Italiano to Frances, then a downhill, but the distance is short. Besides, given the weather, there seemed to be no point to going up to the miradores. Of course, when we arrived at Frances, about 12:30pm, the person working there told us we couldn’t check in until 2:30. Check-in times had not been enforced at all in the previous refugios, but now that we desperately wanted a place to shelter and dry-off, we couldn’t. He very clearly told us we couldn’t check-in until 2:30, though he actually opened the window and began allowing check-ins about 1:30, so were able to claim our canvas, $200 a night tent.\nAt about 2pm, we decided to hike back to Italiano and see if we could get some views. It was clear at this point that the weather was not going to clear, and I feared it was pointless trying to go up the canyon to Frances and Britanico. Indeed, we got back to Italiano, we waited out a heavy rainstorm, and began hiking up. According to a sign posted at Italiano, the rangers close the trail up Miradores Frances and Britanico at 3pm, and we started hiking at 2:30. We just couldn’t wait any longer, and it increasingly appeared futile. We went maybe a mile, saw the very bottom of the glacier, and hiked down. We also couldn’t see anything up-canyon or the Cuernos and it was raining steadily. What a disappointment.\n Our best view of Frances glacier.\nIt absolutely poured all night long, and though I was initially upset that we paid for the fancy tent during the booking process, it was nice to keep all of our stuff, and ourselves, dry. I’m not sure it was $200 nice, but I can’t complain about the heavy canvas and lots of storage space inside the tent. It also got noticeably colder with the passage of the front, and it was much easier to pack up in the morning inside the canvas tent rather than wrestling with our bags under our backpacking tent’s rainfly.\n\n\nDay 7: Frances to Centro. 10.15 miles, 1731 ft. total elevation gain.\nThe next day we had to hike out from Frances. We knew it was about 10 miles, but we were uncertain about mud and trail conditions, especially because it had rained hard all night and we were traumatized from the mud on the previous days. As a result, we left very early, about 7:30am, to make a bus at 3pm. We’d heard different rumors about the shuttle schedule from the Welcome Center back to the entrance station at Laguna Amarga, with one hiker telling us that it came every 20 minutes, while other hikers suggested it was far less frequent. Because we didn’t know the shuttle schedule, we were worried that if we missed a shuttle at say, 2pm, there might not be another shuttle until 2:30, which would mean arriving at 2:45 at the earliest, potentially cutting it close (we later learned the shuttle schedule, as explained here).\nIt turns out we didn’t need any extra motivation to haul ass out of Frances. The pouring rain, the cold, and the wind meant we were more than ready to be done with the hike. I was willing to run back to Centro if I had to, in order to make the bus. The hike itself was actually quite easy. The rain eased up enough that we could see some small portion of the peaks near the Cuernos, and on the southeast side of the park.\nFrom Frances the trail drops steeply to lake level where there is a short beach walk, then climbs a little to Cuernos refugio. After the refugio, it goes over a small ridge and begins an up-and-down trek through the hills at the base of the mountains. It wasn’t particularly muddy, but there were a lot of small creeks running down the trail. Based on the trail structure, I think these creeks are more or less permanent features of the trail, and like most days, it was really hard to keep your boots dry. One piece of advice I’d offer for other hikers is to bring lots of extra pairs of socks and good waterproof boots.\nOnce we turned the corner on Lago Nordenskjold, the hiking was easy, and I knew we were close when we began running into W hikers coming the other direction from Centro. I was surprisingly tired by the time we got back to the hotel area and trail junction with the Mirador Las Torres trail. The distance covered wasn’t that much, and it was fairly easy hiking, so I think my legs were worn out from the start of the hike when I was almost literally running back to Centro to ensure we made the bus and beat the rain. We covered some of the same ground we did on that first day near the end of the hike, though there were far fewer people going up to the Towers. Even though the rain stopped and the clouds lifted for much of this hike, the rain moved in again just as we returned to the Welcome Center and it began pouring. Our hike was over, and on this day we barely even got wet!\nWe arrived at the Welcome Center about 12:30, and had to wait until 2pm for the shuttle, then sat on the bus from 2:30pm to 3, until it left for Puerto Natales.\n\n\n\nAdditional Info\nIn my opinion, guides are not at all necessary unless you really, really want to be in a tour group with others. It’s impossible to lose the trail, with maybe the exception of going over the pass in really bad weather. It’s unlikely weather will be that bad, but hikers basically all go over together so by paying attention and watching others there shouldn’t be any issues.\nTrail signs are not accurate and should be ignored.\nThere were plenty of mosquitoes on the backside. They weren’t a problem for us because it was rainy and windy the entire time, but in good weather they could be an issue.\nWe tried to avoid drinking the water without filtering or boiling first. Everyone kept saying it was fine, but sorry, I just didn’t want to take the chance. Most of the tap water at the refugios appeared to just be water straight from the creeks with varying degrees of clarity.\nAs the hike description makes clear, it isn’t necessary to carry that much water because there is water on the trail everywhere.\nBring your own soap and toilet paper.\nIt is helpful to have all your reservations, bus tickets, and confirmation emails printed out. As noted, these were mostly not checked at the refugios, but the rangers checked them and I wouldn’t trust the refugio system to have an accurate accounting of your food and tent reservations on hand.\nAll the refugios take credit cards though it’s useful to have cash on hand for the shuttle bus and if the credit card machines go down, which happened a few times.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "title": "The Refugio System",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Oh boy, where to even start? I take no joy in reporting that the refugio system on the O is beyond screwed up, though I’m baffled by some of the other comments I’ve seen online. A search of Reddit threads shows people saying that they believe the refugios have lots of supplies, the people are friendly, the services useful, and the food excellent. I have no idea in what year or which universe these people visited the refugios, because my experience was uniformly terrible in myriad ways, both large and small.\nThe most pressing problem is that the refugios are much, much too small. I have read, and had people tell me on the hike, that the refugios on the back side are now handling 70 people a day. Unfortunately, the refugios are constructed to handle maybe 20 people a day. To give some sense of the problem, at both Seron and Los Perros, there are exactly four bathroom stalls, total. There are approximately 40 to 50 men staying at Seron and Los Perros for anywhere between 8 and 16 hours, and there are exactly two or three toilets to use (two at Seron, three at Los Perros for men). At both places, the days we were there, the toilets became clogged and stopped working. Without getting too graphic, the morning we left Los Perros, people were going to the bathroom in a near-overflowing toilet that wouldn’t flush. There was virtually no soap at any of the refugio bathrooms, and toilet paper was hit-and-miss. The bathrooms, especially at Seron and Los Perros, make the Oktoberfest tent bathrooms look like Donald Trump’s golden toilet.\nThere were two showers at Seron, something like three at Los Perros, and only a few more at Grey. The front-side refugios are bigger, because they also handle hikers from the W, but are still not big enough. It wasn’t just the shower and bathroom facilities. All hikers must cook in a designated room or tent, and these are much too small at all refugios, except for maybe Frances, which splits traffic with Cuernos and has multiple small cooking rooms. There are lines for everything: check-in, toilets, sinks, cooking space, seating, dish washing, etc. The food was absolute garbage, and the food and accommodations were obscenely overpriced, though buying food and beer from the minimarkets wasn’t that bad.\nLook, I recognize this is a hike and I don’t expect five star accommodations. I’m most familiar with wilderness camping using nothing but my own supplies, but the O forces everyone into these small spaces. I’m sure the refugios are hard to resupply, and they are handling too many people in an effort to meet public demand. But still, it would be nice if it wasn’t blindingly obvious that every single person associated with the system has stopped caring. Why bother? Permits for every single day are sold out and there is no shortage of people wanting to do the O hike. It’s really a shame.\nI organize this section by refugios this will be how most people encounter the refugios on the hike and certain themes will emerge. I count Centro as a refugio, and note that we skipped Dickson and Chileno, and chose Frances rather than Cuernos because Cuernos was sold out.\n\nPreliminaries\nEveryone must stay at a refugio. There are a few basic options as to your accommodations, with some variation by refugio. Hikers can stay inside a dorm style building with a bed, outside in a refugio owned tent, outside in a fancier, larger canvas tent, or outside using their own gear. The fancier canvas tents are available at Chileno and Frances for sure, but not any other refugios as far as I’m aware.\nAt each refugio, there is a designated area to setup your own tent if that’s what you’re doing, as we did. The refugio owned tents have slightly better locations on the grounds in terms of wind-shelter many of them are located on wooden platforms, and they are slightly larger dome-style tents as compared to a typical backpacking tent. For those using their own gear, wooden platforms are mostly not available, though at some refugios (e.g., Seron), you might get lucky.\nAll refugios have a small market with some basic things like alcohol, candy bars, snacks, etc. though again, the quantity of items varies quite dramatically by refugio. Paine Grande had a full bar (good luck getting a seat or service), but that was the exception. Some of the refugios also had hot food that could be ordered during the day, mostly pizza and burgers. This food is separate from the pre-paid meals that many hikers buy, which are served on a schedule and I would not depend on this food to get through the hike. Because the dining area cannot accommodate everyone at once, the meal service for pre-ordered food is staggered. Again, this is the basic structure, but there is variation among refugios.\nFor check-in, passports and the PDI card are required. The PDI card is the print-out given to you when you enter the country of Chile. It apparently entitles you to tax-free charges on the stay, though it wasn’t clear to us what we actually got from it since we booked and paid for our refugios in advance. Still, at check-in, every refugio asked to see it. These requirements are annoying because it means one has to backpack with both their passport and that piece of paper.\n\n\nReservation System\nI have nothing much interesting to say about the online reservation system. Hikers completing the O must book sites separately at Vertice and Fantastico Sur, the two companies which run the refugios. Good luck lining up dates between the two. This process was incredibly difficult and complicated, and I heard other hikers complain about it as well. There are various websites and Reddit threads that tell you how to book the refugios, but the system to do so is awful, and the page where you pay looks like you’re about to download a virus.\nFor our trip, we were able to reserve all of our sites using our own gear, except for our last day. Both Cuernos and Frances were sold-out, but Frances had the fancier canvas tents available (for $200). We booked that because we had no choice if we wanted to do the hike on our allotted timeline. Despite our purchase email from Fantastico Sur (which uses the website LasTorres.com and at last check wasn’t working) saying we would receive a separate confirmation email, we never did despite repeated attempts to email Las Torres (in Spanish). It didn’t matter as check-in basically consisted of showing your ID, and the worker checking their list to match your name.\nVertice owns the refugios of Dickson, Los Perros and Grey. Their reservation system requires that you book stays at each of those for three consecutive nights, even though it is not a park requirement that you stop at all three. As detailed in the hike summary, it appears to be perfectly acceptable to skip Dickson and go directly to Los Perros from Seron, but Vertice requires you to have a reservation at Dickson. We did just that, and lost our $10. It’s not a lot of money, but demonstrates the general approach Vertice and Fantastico Sur take, which is basically to extract as much profit out of the system as possible.\nWhen booking the refugio stays, there is also an option to purchase breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We faced a decision about how much food we wanted to buy as we were mostly carrying our own gear and our own stove to cook our backpacking food. Still, seven days of food for two people is a lot to carry and would have made our packs very heavy. We decided to carry most of our own food but supplement it with a few meals purchased here and there, simply to reduce our pack weight. The food was almost uniformly awful, with Seron a bit of an exception. If you are a vegetarian, you simply tell them that when you check-in and they will prepare vegetarian meals, including lunches.\n\n\nThe Refugios\n\nCentro\nCentro is not a refugio proper, but a campground with showers, a bathroom, and a camping space. It’s close to the Welcome Center and the hotel, and provides access to the Base Las Torres hike. It’s also the biggest camping area. We were able to check-in when we arrived at about 9am. The workers simply gave us a sticker, told us to find an empty spot, put up our tent and attach the sticker. The bathroom area was okay (no soap though), the showers were hot in the afternoon, and we were done early enough in the day there was not a line for the showers. The cooking tent is large-ish, though not large enough, and is also where most people drop their packs for the day hike up to Las Torres. Looking back, Centro was neither particularly nice nor objectionable. The bathrooms could have been nicer and cleaner, but the camping area is fine, and hikers are able to spread out a little bit.\n\n\nSeron\nSeron is a Fantastico Sur refugio and seemed to be the second smallest (after Los Perros), but also had the most helpful employees. The camping area is a big field near the buildings, and there was plenty of space to camp away from people if one wanted. However, the wind was howling when we were there, so most people pitched their tent close to the hillside on the northeast or southeast side of the field in order to get some shelter. There were two bathroom stalls and showers separated by gender, though that broke down pretty quickly as lines formed for each. The water was hot and the shower was fine. By the morning, one of the toilets stopped flushing.\n The camping area at Seron for the refugio owned tents on platforms. Lots of space, but not a lot of protection from the wind.\nWe thought we’d purchased dinner, breakfast, and lunch for Frances, but when we arrived at Seron, the employees told us that we actually had meals there. There are two dinner seatings because the inside dining area at Seron is small. I’m not sure if you could order other food here, but there are coolers with sodas and alcohol, along with some snacks. Our dinner was split pea soup, salmon on rice pilaf, and a shared salad with bread. It was not bad and at the time I thought, okay, the food in these refugios might actually be decent. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, yogurt, and the like, lunch was a salmon, mayo, and onion mix sandwich that was better than it sounds. It also came with some trail mix. The vegetarian version was sauteed, marinated vegetables with fresh tomatoes that the vegetarian in our group thought was good.\n\n\nDickson\nWe did not spend the night at Dickson so I can’t provide much feedback on it. The buildings looked nice enough, the cooking and eating area was not heated when we were there, despite being attached to the main building, and the bathroom was small. It was very annoying that when we walked up in the pouring rain we stood around for a minute or two trying to figure out which building to head to for a warmup while a group of employees sat on the porch and watched us without bothering to give us any directions.\n Dickson camping area.\n\n\nLos Perros\nThe smallest and almost certainly the worst refugio, though our experience at Paine Grande was a close second. The campground itself is in a stand of trees that provided decent shelter from the wind but didn’t offer much space. The cooking and eating area was tiny, and there were queues to do both for most of the night. The cooking tent also become very hot with all the stoves and bodies moving around in there. The bathrooms were tiny and gross, and there was no hot water. People had clearly used the shower to wash off their shoes and mud was splattered everywhere. It had rained a lot so much of the area surrounding the buildings was extremely muddy, which made it difficult to walk around in camp shoes. By the morning, the toilets in both the men’s and women’s bathrooms were clogged and didn’t flush. The whole place was very dirty and didn’t feel taken care of at all.\n The camping area at Los Perros, which wasn tight on space but had decent shelter from the wind.\n\n\nGrey\nGrey is certainly nicer and bigger than both Seron and Los Perros, though the attitude of the employees left something to be desired. The shower and bathroom areas were also larger and cleaner, with hot water and soap. Grey’s cooking and eating area was only three tables, but it felt bigger than either Los Perros or Seron. We ate breakfast at Grey, which consisted of a small buffet with really bad coffee, okay eggs, stale bread (which ran out halfway through service), yogurts, cereals, and juice. We also ordered lunch, and it was terrible. I couldn’t actually tell what the meat-based sandwich was made of, as it looked and tasted like dog food, while the vegetarian option was smashed lime beans on bread that was basically tasteless. They did give us Toblerones in the lunches.\nThe camping area seemed a bit more spread out and was in pine trees, which provided some protection from the wind and didn’t feel too crowded. Grey might have the nicest camping area in terms of space and privacy.\n\n\nPaine Grande\nThe refugio feels much bigger than anything hikers encounter up to that point, but it also feels extremely crowded. The ferry to Pudeto stops at Paine Grande and it is the one refugio that all the W and O hikers share, as well as other hikers who use it as a base to see Grey Glacier. There is a bar upstairs in the refugio, though it was extremely crowded after about 4pm. The bathrooms are relatively far from the camping area, but are basically fine. The problem was that the employees closed them for cleaning at about 8pm, when everyone is getting ready for bed, and they were closed again at about 7am, when everyone was waking up. They couldn’t clean them during off hours? It was nice that both the bathrooms and showers were at least cleaned somewhat regularly, and there were no giant queues to use them. The cooking room at Paine Grande was the biggest and nicest, had the most plugs and outlets of any refugio, and while it seemed a little dirty in the cooking area, the seating area was fine. I heard from some other hikers that the employees kicked them out of the cooking area at exactly 10pm, despite them being in the middle of making their dinner.\nWe paid for our dinner at Paine, which consisted of a buffet of chicken and beef, along with mashed potatoes, beans, hummus, bread, and some little desserts. The chicken and at least one of the desserts were edible. Breakfast was similarly terrible, with runny eggs, and the standard yogurts, cereals, etc. Lunch was again terrible sandwiches, with the vegetarian option consisting almost entirely of smashed black beans smeared between two pieces of white bread. I can’t remember what the non-vegetarian option was because I threw it out. It baffled me that they gave hikers some energy powder for their water. Who wants to mix that into their bladder or water bottles while on a hike? There was some trail mix, dried fruit, and other stuff, but I basically threw this entire lunch in the trash.\nThe camping area at Paine Grande is the worst among the refugios. The refugio itself is located at the bottom of a canyon, and the wind blows straight down the canyon all day long, and for us, into the night. There are a few barricades setup to offer some protection to tents, but a lot of the ground behind the barricades was extremely uneven and dusty. We thought we got lucky by being able to setup behind a barricade, but quickly realized that the lack of grass meant dust constantly blew into our tent.\n The camping area at Paine Grande. Good views, but this area completely filled up with tents in the evening, and it was very windy.\nIt was very crowded, with tents packed into the camping area. On our stay, it began raining around 9 or 10pm, the wind picked up, and nearly every hiker was inside their tent. Because we were all basically on top of each other, talking in one tent meant everyone else could hear their conservation. The crowds also meant that people were walking to and from the distant bathroom all night, and it was just a loud chaotic scene in general.\nThe employees at Paine were those who most obviously did not give a crap about anything. We went into the minimarket and the woman working the cash register eventually looked up and rang us up after finishing her texts. When we went to check-in, two women didn’t acknowledge us at all, and the woman copped an attitude when some other hikers asked her to explain something in English. The employees blasted EDM at both dinner and breakfast into the dining room. At around 10 or 11pm, between the wind and rain, I could hear loud music and yelling, like teenagers having a party. It was the employees in their own large tent drinking and screaming! Imagine 100 people or so crammed into backpacking tents within about four feet of each other on all sides, preparing for a 13 mile hike in the rain the next day, at midnight, listening to 10 or 15 refugio employees hosting their own personal dance club. It wasn’t cute or funny, just unbelievably unprofessional and annoying. The only saving grace is that sometimes we couldn’t hear them over the wind and rain. And, we weren’t even that close to the party! I cannot believe a hiker didn’t go over to them and tell them off (or maybe they did, and the employees didn’t care). I’m not trying to be a scold as I worked in the service industry for years and I think my tolerance for bad behavior is pretty high; this was completely ridiculous. For what it’s worth, most of the employees in the morning looked hungover.\n\n\nFrances\nFrances is situated in some trees on a hill, and while nice looking, it’s a bit of a haul up and down to the bathrooms and minimart. The buildings look the newest, and the bathrooms and showers seem to be in the best shape. My biggest gripe with Frances, besides the walk up and down to the store and bathrooms, is that there are smaller, separated cooking and eating areas, but they are much too small and don’t provide much protection from the elements. For us in the rain, we were basically cooking and sitting outside, which was cold (though dry). Still, the camping area is a little more spread out and Frances just seemed newer and nicer than the other refugios.\n This is a bad picture, but it’s the inside of our $200 canvas tent. The tent is off the ground and completely encased in heavy canvas with a soft mat on the bottom.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe refugio situation should not stop anyone from doing the hike, but everyone should know that the situation is bad. They are small, crowded, dirty, the food is bad, and the employee attitudes ranged from mild indifference to outright hostility. The online booking and reservation system is its own problem. I don’t have much hope for improvement given the overwhelming popularity of the hike, but I think it’s important that hikers realize what they are getting into. Maybe more public complaints to the park or government will force some improvement.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "title": "Problems with the O",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am trying to balance realism with pessimism, and be honest without being too negative. Let me reiterate what my experience was: the scenery was absolutely world-class, about the best I’ve ever seen, especially for such a long duration hike. All seven days offered incredible views. As I mentioned before, there is almost no step on the trail where there isn’t something amazing to look at.\nThe problems seem recent in development, which makes it feel like one of those things so common to people my age and younger: “you should have seen it back then”.\nThe refugio system is covered in its own section here, though I discuss the reservation system.\n\nCrowds\nThe trail is crowded, at least compared to places I’m used to hiking in the Mountain West. The backside of the O is less crowded than the W side, but because everyone leaves from the same refugios at roughly the same time, you are almost never alone. Hikers are almost always within shouting distance of one another.\nThe front side, which includes W hikers going both directions, is even more crowded. Not only are hikers within shouting distance of one another, they are almost always within visual distance of each other as well. Crowds can be annoying in that it changes the feel of the hike, but most hikers were nice people and a little bit of a community forms after a few days.\nIt did feel like we were constantly having to negotiate passing and being passed on the trails. For example, if we passed a large, slower group, I’d be afraid of taking too long getting a picture 200 yards up the trail for fear of being passed by the group again. We found ourselves hop-scotching other groups frequently, and woe to the hiker that has the misfortune of being stuck behind a 10 or 15 person tour group. Most groups and hikers will let faster walkers pass, but this was far from universal.\nThe hike to the Towers is its own animal. It was packed, and we were almost always in a line of hikers. Most of these people are day visitors, most of them are slow hikers, and most of them have no sense of trail etiquette. Stopping in the middle of the trail to take a picture or re-adjust things? Check. Refusing to let faster hikers pass? Check. Refusing to yield to uphill hikers? Check. Stepping in front of incoming hikers only to go slow? Check.\n Another picture of the crowds coming up to Las Torres. This was by far the most crowded hike on the circuit.\nThe Towers hike was by far the worst, but these problems exist to some extent on the entire trail, though the stretch around Grey, Paine Grande and Italiano was worse than on the backside. Again, the crowds aren’t disqualifying, but they are a thing.\n\n\nThe Refugio System and Scheduling\nI detail the exact problems with the refugio system here, so this is a slightly different issue mentioned to me by a few other hikers. Because you need reservations at each of the refugios, and because you must stay at the refugios, it’s impossible to keep your own schedule. If you aren’t feeling well and want a rest day, you can’t decide to take one. If you are feeling strong and want to keep hiking, you can’t. In other words, it isn’t really a self-directed hike because you must stay on the schedule dictated by the refugio system. As mentioned, a lot of the mileage between the refugios was too low for us, but there wasn’t anything we could do about. If something goes wrong, like a missed bus or delayed bag, you have to try and rebook all your reservations. It’s just not a system that gives hikers any freedom over their itinerary.\n\n\nTrail Conditions\nThe trail itself is a disaster, which makes the hiking much harder than similar miles in the U.S. on forest service or national park system trails. We joked that the trail is an old guanaco trail as it seems graded for animals rather than humans. Switchbacks? Never heard of them. It’s just an old-timey trail, similar to the AT in that it goes up and down seemingly without reason, rather than gaining and holding elevation or taking an efficient route. Okay, most experienced hikers can deal with that.\nThe real problem is that much of the trail was basically destroyed and extremely muddy. I recognize this sounds like a minor inconvenience, but when you are constantly having to walk through and around mud, for miles and miles on end, it becomes exceedingly tedious and tiring. It was almost impossible to keep our boots dry. And, the later in the day you hike a section, the worse the trail conditions become. We hiked through almost nonstop rain, so I’m guessing the mud is not as bad in the middle of summer or during sunny weather, but the mud really, really slowed us down. Further, because of the way the trail is graded, the mud makes steep sections exceedingly slick and dangerous. The section from the top of the pass to Grey in particular was more of a full body workout than a hike, as one constantly has to sit down to shimmy down steep sections, grab trees for balance, scramble down rocks, and generally negotiate a slick and steep trail that would not be out of place in a rainforest. Again, it is hard to say how much of the mud was due to the rain, and how much conditions improve if things are dry, but my sense is that some amount of mud is always present. Besides the section from the pass to Grey, the Dickson to Los Perros section was also in very poor conditions. It was muddier and longer, but less steep, which made it a little bit more manageable.\n Miles and miles of mud made for difficult and slow hiking.\nIn other areas, particularly after Cuernos, small creeks run down the trails. I would assume there would be less water if it wasn’t raining, but it’s clear the trail has been eroded enough that the creek bed is now the trail. There is a lot of rock hopping here, which makes the going slow. The water and mud issues have caused hikers to create side trails, and in many places there is a zig-zagging network of trails as hikers move around the mud and water. And in some places, there is almost no way to avoid going off trail and contributing to the problem. One pool near Cuernos was probably six inches deep across the entire trail between bushes–there was simply no way to avoid getting your feet wet without going off trail. The creation of these side-trail networks is the National Park Service’s worst nightmare and I now understand why they spend so much time and energy telling people to remain on the trails, and why they close wet trails.\nAt some point, CONAF is going to have to engage in some serious trail building to fix these problems. Given the crowds and weather, these trail conditions are simply unsustainable, not to mention the impact on the environment.\n\n\nCosts\nChile in general is not cheap, and in some ways the bureaucracy around the hike seems designed to squeeze every dollar possible out of visitors. Here is a summary of our costs, beginning with the bus to the park.\n\nBus ticket, Puerto Natales to Laguna Amarga: $10/person\nShuttle bus ticket, Laguna Amarga to Welcome Center $3.77/person\nPark Entrance ticket: $49/person\nSeron campsite for two people: $50\nBreakfast, lunch, and dinner at Seron : $88/person\nDickson campsite for two people: $20 (didn’t use)\nLos Perros campsite for two people: $20\nGrey campsite for two people: $20\nBreakfast and lunch at Grey: $38/person\nPaine Grande campsite for two people: $24\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner at Paine Grande: $70/person\nFrances campsite for two people: $50\nCanvas tent at Frances: $200\nShuttle bus ticket, Welcome Center to Laguna Amarga: $3.77/person\nBus ticket, Laguna Amarga to Puerto Natales: $10/person\nTotal cost per person (including campsites for two people): $656.54\n\n\n\nThe Weather\nThis one is hard because I don’t know what normal weather is, but it’s Patagonia, and the park is near the ocean, which pumps a lot of moisture through. For us, we hiked in the rain, camped in the rain, ate in the rain, and slept in the rain. I actually got used to it after a few days. The wind was also bad, but that’s more normal than the amount of rain we experienced.\nIt was intermittently cold, though not overwhelmingly so. With rain comes clouds, and lack of views. I just don’t know how to conceptualize dealing with the weather because if you can’t see anything, it’s not worth going. But how many hikers complete the O every year and have bad weather for a few of their hiking days? A few? Some? Most? There is no easy way to think about this, but honestly, if I’d known how bad the weather would be, I’m not sure I would have done the hike.\n Thick clouds ruined a lot of the views.\nIf one could absolutely guarantee good weather, I think the good definitely outweighs the bad, but with the uncertainty, it becomes a more difficult decision. When I asked others whether the rain was normal, the typical response was something like, “es Patagonia,” meaning it’s Patagonia, what are you going to do? My fishing guide canceled our fishing trip because he said it was the worst summer weather he’d ever seen, which gives some indication as to how unusual this was. But, the rain we experienced wasn’t a week-long event. Most people I talked to said it had been going on for almost the entire month of February, and was expected to continue through much of March. Hiking in the rain is miserable; hiking in the rain and not seeing anything is worse. And forget trying to plan for the weather, the forecast in the morning for the afternoon wasn’t accurate, never mind a forecast weeks or months in advance when you need to book your reservations.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "text": "We flew from the U.S. to Santiago, then to Punta Arenas. There are apparently some direct flights from Santiago to Puerto Natales, which is the jumping off point to the park, but it’s far more common to fly into Punta Arenas.\nUpon landing in Santiago, we had to gather our backpacks and clear customs, and we were immediately sent to secondary inspection. In the baggage claim area there is a paper that must be completed, and there were no working pens when we arrived, so the lesson here is, have a pen on you (not in your baggage). I’m guessing almost everyone bringing a backpack into the country is sent to secondary. They x-rayed our bags, then asked us to open them. Based on our Google research, we weren’t entirely clear about what were allowed to bring into the country, but we had normal backpacker food: clif bars, cookies, jerky (in its original wrapping), powdered mash potatoes, mac and cheese, etc. After they asked us to open our bags, they asked whether we had any dried fruit (which we didn’t). It’s possible that’s the only thing they care about because they didn’t confiscate or examine any of our other food. I’m still not sure what is allowed and what isn’t, but this whole process through secondary inspection probably took about ten minutes.\nAfter landing in Punta Arenas, we stayed for three nights due to the timing of our flights and the start of our refugio reservations. This is absolutely too long in Punta Arenas but I highly recommend spending at least one night, and maybe two. One of our backpacks was lost by Latam, and it was one of about six pieces of luggage from our flight that was lost. It was found within a few hours, and when we returned to the airport to pick it up, the employees were unfazed went back into a room with apparently a lot of luggage, and returned with our backpack. It seemed like luggage is lost pretty regularly and Latam has a lot of flights from Santiago to Punta Arenas. My guess is that your luggage is likely to end up on a flight to Punta Arenas, just not necessarily your flight. For this reason, I think it’s smart to give yourself at least a one day buffer in Punta Arenas, just in case your bag doesn’t make it.\nThe bus ride from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales is about three hours, and the bus station in both places is in the center of town, within easy walking distance to most hotels and hostels.\n\nLogistics to the Park from Puerto Natales\nFrom Puerto Natales, the buses takes about two hours to reach the park entrance, called Laguna Amarga, which is a cluster of official buildings outside the actual Welcome Center. Here you show your entrance ticket which you should have already purchased online, or you stand in line and buy a ticket. The system for both buying your ticket and showing your ticket is extremely stupid, and here’s how it works.\nThe bus pulls up to the gate, a ranger boards and tells you the rules of the park (no fires, don’t litter, etc.) Then you disembark the bus and go to an office to either show your ticket or stand in line to purchase one, along with your identification. You must have your ticket and passport on you, instead of in your backpack/luggage, because your bus drives away to a parking area. If you made the mistake of leaving your ticket or passport in your backpack, you’ll have to ask permission to walk to the bus in the parking area, wait for the driver to open the luggage compartment, find your backpack, grab your ticket and passport, walk back to the building to show your ticket, then walk back to the bus and get your backpack. Of course, we had a moment of panic because one member of our party didn’t have her passport on her, but the person checking her ticket didn’t ask to see it (though she had retrieved a photo on her phone), despite the ranger who boarded the bus five minutes earlier making it clear that identification was needed. At the time we were there, tickets on the phone were acceptable.\nAfter you buy or show your ticket, you walk back to your bus, grab your stuff, then head to another park shuttle bus that will take you the approximately four miles to the Welcome Center. This shuttle bus costs 3,000 CLP. Hope you brought small denomination cash! The driver will make change, but everyone is shoving money in his face as he’s trying to rip off little slips of paper that represent your shuttle ticket. Lots of different bus companies arrive to the front gate about the same time so there may not be room on the first shuttle bus, hence the mad scramble to buy a shuttle bus ticket (and why you don’t want to have get your park ticket and passport from your luggage because you’ll end up at the back of the line). For those that miss the first shuttle bus, it will come back and take the remaining visitors, but this takes time.\nThe shuttle bus drops off passengers at the Welcome Center, which is a short walk to Centro camping area, refugio, and Hotel Torres del Paine (I believe the shuttle makes a second stop at the hotel, but I’m not sure as I got off the bus at the Welcome Center). The Welcome Center has some seating, a little cafe, and a few souvenirs, but it’s much smaller than a typical entrance station you’d find at a U.S. national park. There are also people behind a desk who will answer questions.\n\n\nLogistics from the Park to Laguna Amarga and Puerto Natales\nWhen you leave the park, you have to buy another shuttle bus ticket and repeat the process. The shuttles are not regular, but are timed with the buses. For example, our bus leaving Laguna Amarga back to Puerto Natales, was at 3pm, as were a number of other buses. The shuttle service began at 2pm from the front of the Welcome Center. Lots of people queued up for the bus starting at about 1:30pm, but the driver first called for people on buses leaving at 2pm. Because there weren’t many, he then filled the shuttle bus, to standing room, with everyone else. Buying tickets from him was almost more chaotic than on the ride into the park as the queue quickly disintegrated. I think people were really panicked about missing their bus back to Puerto Natales (and who could blame them after camping for days in the rain). Some people were left waiting at the Welcome Center because the shuttle bus filled up, but it made repeated trips, and the private buses back to Natales don’t leave until the shuttle bus has completed its rounds back-and-forth from the Welcome Center.\nThis system doesn’t work nearly as efficiently as it should as hikers jockey for position, and buying the shuttle tickets is disorganized and confusing, especially with the bus driver shouting instructions in Spanish to a group of people who mostly don’t speak Spanish. You could always walk the four miles.\nBack to O Hike Overview"
