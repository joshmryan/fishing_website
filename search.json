    "text": "Bear River Cutthroat–Cache Valley\nIn Cache Valley, there are a number of options for catching the Bear River cutthroat as all local waters contain them. The Logan River is the largest river, and most obvious. It’s a classic western free-stone trout stream, fishable from about early July through early November. In most places, the Logan is no more than knee deep, though there are some larger holes.\nBrown trout, and even some brook and rainbow trout also exist in the Logan, but the higher one goes in the canyon, the more likely it is one will catch a cutt. I mentally divide the river into lower, middle, and upper sections. I think of the lower section as from the mouth of the canyon where a small lake exists (locally referred to as “first dam”), to about Card Canyon, where there is a picnic area and turnout on the highway. From there, the middle section flows close to the road in most places in a tight canyon until the road climbs high above the river, referred to as the “dugway.” I’d never heard that term until I moved to Utah, and I’m still not sure what it means, but the road cuts across the face of a mountain and climbs until it once again meets the river. Temple Fork flows into the Logan shortly after the dugway. The upper part of the Logan is my favorite area to fish as the river is usually a little farther away from the road, and the fishing and scenery are good. However, this area probably receives the most pressure, though pressure on the Logan is light compared to most well-known western trout streams.\nI almost always fish above about Card Canyon (haven’t had much success lower), and the middle canyon section is mostly brown trout. My experience has been that after the dugway, in the upper section, there are more cutts than browns. The fishing is generally good on drys, especially in mid to late summer. Current regulations prohibit fishing from Red Banks Campground upstream to Idaho until the second weekend in July, though in a good water year the river will be still be blown out by then.\nNear the top of the canyon, the Logan River leaves the highway and flows almost due north-south from its headwaters in Idaho. This area is referred to as Franklin Basin, and there is a good forest road that parallels the river in this area with lots of dispersed camping, though it can get crowded. Beaver Creek flows into the Logan from the northeast at the start of Franklin Basin (moving upstream) and the highway flows alongside of it after leaving the Logan.\n Franklin Basin in the fall.\nThe Logan in Franklin Basin, Beaver Creek, and the Temple Fork are almost excluisvely cutts and have good fishing. I’ve had a lot of success in Franklin Basin, and in Spawn Creek, which meets Temple Fork a mile upstream of Temple Fork’s confluence with the Logan. A short hike up Spawn Creek offers nice beaver ponds, but I sometimes find the fish here can be surprisingly picky. I’ve never seen anyone else fishing Spawn Creek. I’ve had less success in Temple Fork, though I have caught fish in it. A lot of it is pretty brushy, and the more open parts don’t seem to hold a lot of fish, so I generally prefer Spawn Creek. Franklin Basin is also brushy in parts, especially farther upstream, but there are a lot of fish in there.\n Beaver ponds on Spawn Creek.\nLower down, Right Hand Fork flows into the Logan from the right hand side of the highway (moving upstream), and is all cutthroats. There is a good forest service road up some of Right Hand Fork, and a campground near the junction of two forest roads. There is also a trail that continues up Right Hand Fork after the road ends, following the creek for about 1.5 to 2 miles. Right Hand Fork seems to be a popular place to catch cutts. There are a few promotional videos online of media personalities and DWR employees talking about the slam and where to catch Bear River cutts, and it often looks like they are in Right Hand Fork.\nThe creek is separated from the mainstem Logan by a weir built a few years ago to protect it from encroaching browns. Right Hand Fork was then treated in 2013 to kill the browns and replanted with cutts sometime after. When I started fishing it in 2016, it was full of cutts and once I figured out how to deal with the brush, there were days when I caught dozens of fish. Since then, the fish seem to have become a little bit smarter so the fishing does not seem quite as good as it did in 2016 or 2017, although fish densities are very high. The other problem with Right Hand Fork is that is a very small and brushy stream for much of its course near the road and trail, so it can be difficult to find a spot to cast. Rattlesnakes and moose are hazards.\n Right Hand Fork in the fall.\nHaving said all that about the Logan and its tributaries, I caught my Bear River in Curtis Creek, which flows through Hardware Ranch WMA into the Blacksmith Fork. The Blacksmith Fork is the second largest river in the valley, and the fishing is great in mid-summer. Because it’s smaller, it also clears from runoff a lot earlier than the Logan, making it fishable by mid-June in an average/good water year. Unfortunately, probably about 90% of the fish in Blacksmith Fork are browns (or at least the ones I’ve caught). In fact, the DWR has a bonus limit of four additional brown trout, meaning you can catch and keep eight brown trout per day (as of 2023).\nThe ratio of cutts to browns in Curtis Creek is better than the mainstem Blacksmith Fork, probably something like 4 to 1 rather than 9 to 1. For my cutt slam, I caught the fish in mid-April as Curtis Creek drains a small area and is probably the first creek in the area to clear from runoff. Rock Creek, which flows into Blacksmith Fork a little lower, also has some cutts and clears relatively early as well. If one drives on the forest road through Hardware Ranch, the road eventually meets Rock Creek again higher up. It’s easy to park near the bridge and fish up the meadow, or move downstream and fish through some smaller meadows and into a small canyon. I’ve done this a few times and caught a lot of fish (mostly browns). The only drawback is that it’s about an hour drive from Logan each way so I don’t fish it that often, though neither does anyone else. In the spring and summer, there is a lot of dispersed camping in the area and people like to use the forest road through Hardware Ranch to see how fast they can drive their side-by-sides.\n A local enjoying the Blacksmith Fork river.\nThe other option for a Bear River cutt is Left Hand Fork of the Blacksmith, which flows past a number of campgrounds on Left Hand Fork road. This is one of my favorite places to fish early in the season (before Memorial Day) because it clears early and there are a lot of fish, but it’s almost all browns, in my experience. Unfortunately the quantity of dispersed camping and campgrounds means it is overrun by Memorial Day, and the area is an absolute nightmare during the height of summer. I’ve nearly experienced dog attacks and ATV crashes on Left Hand Fork Road. People seem to enjoy dropping their trailer or tent in a spot and reserving it for the entire summer. The forest service has made some efforts to better organize the dispersed camping and enforce the 14 day stay limit, though as far as I can tell, these efforts do not yet seem to be effective.\n Left Hand Fork of Blacksmith Fork.\nIf I were trying to catch the Bear River cutt, I’d probably start in the upper Logan or Franklin Basin, and failing that, go to Right Hand Fork. The fishing in the Logan and Franklin Basin is easier because they are bigger waters and there is more room to cast and wade. But, if those two didn’t work for whatever reason, Right Hand Fork is almost a sure thing if you can find a spot to make a cast without spooking the fish or get tangled in the brush. Spawn Creek is also a good option, but it requires a 15 to 20 minute hike up to the beaver ponds, and there are brooks and browns in addition to cutthroats.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Raft River Mountains\nThis is widely accepted to be the most difficult fish in the slam to catch. For most people, the Raft River Range is the farthest drive, the creeks are tiny, and there isn’t a ton of information on where to catch the fish. Some of the online promotional videos I’ve seen show people fishing water in private land or only make vague references to access points. I couldn’t figure any of this out so I stuck to the most obvious water: Onemile Creek. There is a forest road that goes up it, and my research seemed to suggest this was the best bet.\nWhen I drove up the forest road, there was a jeep parked in a turnout: another guy and his wife also looking to catch the Yellowstone for their slam. From that turnout, they mentioned there is a relatively well-defined hole only a short walk up the creek where they’d brought a fish up. Onemile creek is very small and doesn’t even look like it can hold fish, but unlike a lot of creeks this size in Utah, it wasn’t that brushy. I started downstream of the hole they mentioned, fished up to it, and had absolutely no success. I hooked a shockingly large fish in that hole, got it to the surface and lost it. I made a few more casts, but it was clear the fish wasn’t coming back. I continued fishing up Onemile Creek for a while, and found no signs of life.\n Onemile creek is small.\nAt that point I wasn’t sure what to do. Downstream of the turnout where I first parked, there was another bad looking forest road that went across the creek and into another drainage. The creek just seems to be called Sawmill Canyon and I wasn’t sure it was even fishable, but I had read that it held Yellowstone cutts. I also wasn’t sure if I could get my car up the road so I rode my mountain bike on the road over a short hill and then up the canyon. I picked an arbitrary point to take the quick hike down to the creek from the road. Sawmill Canyon was even smaller than Onemile and was very brushy.\nThis all seemed futile as I started fishing but pretty quickly thought I had some fish hitting my dry fly that I let sink in some of the holes. I wasn’t entirely sure they were bites, but it did give me motivation to keep fishing. Within less than an hour, I caught a small Yellowstone cutt out of Sawmill. I caught a few more, all smaller than 6 inches. The fishing isn’t easy, but there seem to be more fish than in Onemile, and I think it gets less pressure. It wasn’t all that hard to get to either, the walk/bike in was maybe a mile or mile and a half.\n Sawmill Canyon is small and brushy.\nThere is a nice forest service campground nearby on Clear Creek, along with lots of dispersed camping. We were going to try and summit Bull Moutain the next day (highest point in the Raft River Range), but it started thunderstorming early in the morning so we left and drove back to Cache Valley. Clear Creek is quite fun to fish as there are a ton of fish that seemed to look like cutts, but I think they are Inland Redband trout, as they are missing the orange slash under the jaw and have a pink lateral stripe. The DWR’s website does not mention Clear Creek as a possible water in which to find Yellowstones.\n Trout from Clear Creek. I think these are Inland Redband trout.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Boulder Mountain\nLiving in Cache Valley is an advantage for reaching the Bear River and Yellowstone cutts (the Raft River is less than a two hour drive), but it is a decided disadvantage for the next fish I attempted to catch, the Colorado River cutt. This one is probably slightly easier to catch than the Yellowstone, but the geography of its native waters make it a long trip from Cache Valley. I had a trip planned to the Capitol Reef area for some hiking, so I did research on streams near the park entrance that might hold Colorado River cutts. When we visit Capitol Reef we like to stay at a nice forest service campground about a half hour from the park entrance. The DWR website lists Pine Creek as close to that area so I started there with really no other plan if that didn’t work. Pine Creek flows off the northwest side of Boulder Mountain, but access is at a low enough elevation that isn’t too far of a drive from Bicknell.\n Pine Creek, near Bicknell, UT.\nI could find almost no information on the fishing aside from that single mention on the website so I had no idea what the road condition was, how big the creek was, or where to fish. The road turned out to be a good forest service road that I drove up until I found a spot to pull over and walk to the creek. Where I parked, the road isn’t alongside the creek so you can’t see the water until you get closer. Surprise, surprise, Pine Creek is tiny with what I would characterize as “moderate” brush (a running theme for Utah fly fishing). But, on walking up to the creek, I could see fish!\nDespite the look of the creek, it was relatively easy fishing; I walked upstream, found a brush-free spot, made a cast with a dry fly, and usually hooked a small fish. I caught a few quickly and had a nice time working my way upstream. I had plans to leave and fish the Fremont which is supposed to hold larger brown trout but as I was packing up after fishing Pine Creek, I stepped on my rod and broke it. I didn’t realize this until I drove to the Fremont, made a cast, and the top of my rod flew off. That was something like the third time I’d broken a rod, and there would be (and will be) more.\n\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Salt Lake City Area\nI left the Bonneville for last as I assumed it would be the easiest. I am in Salt Lake City often enough that I thought I’d just catch it quickly when in the area. Unfortunately, by the end of the summer, I just hadn’t gotten around to it. After an airport run, I thought I’d just go to one the creeks that flows out of the Wasatch into the valley. The closest water to the airport I could find was Mill Creek, which is right above the City and holds Bonnies according to the DWR website. I’d never been up there so I had no idea what the fishing was like.\nIt turns out Mill Creek Canyon is a very popular place to recreate on a Sunday afternoon. And, you have to pay to recreate in the canyon on the way out, which seems very odd. I fought traffic, found a place to park on the road, and walked down to the creek. This was late September and I was surprised to find a little snow on the ground because the sun doesn’t reach the creek in the fall or winter months. The shadows, combined with the warmish air temperature which caused the snow to melt and re-freeze, produced maximum slickness when wading.\n Mill Creek.\nAlso, unsurprisingly, Mill Creek is tiny and moderately brushy, and it looked just okay in terms of fishability. The low light in the canyon made it difficult to see my dry fly and for about the first hour, nothing happened. This was all very annoying because the Bonnie was supposed to be the easy one. I began thinking the DWR made a mistake and regretting my decision to fish Mill Creek. I finally hooked a fish, after a tough, cold wade. On the way out, I had to sit in traffic waiting to pay the fee. I completed the cutt slam in one year, but I feel comfortable saying that will be my last visit to Mill Canyon.\nI probably should have gone to a larger, nicer river to catch the Bonnie and most anglers will drive from Salt Lake City to the north slope of the Uintas to catch the fish there, or fish the Ogden or Weber. All are good options; Mill Creek has the advantage of being twenty minutes from SLC, but the experience is not what we think of in terms of western trout fishing.\n\n\nSummary\nRelative to the other state slams I’ve done or attempted, Utah was the easiest, and is a good starter slam. The driving distances are likely shorter than in Wyoming, and the fishing is pretty easy with the exception of the Yellowstone Cutt. The Bear River and Bonneville should, more or less, be gimmes, with the Colorado River somewhat tougher (though I got lucky Pine Creek was a good spot for me). Catching the Yellowstone out of Sawmill Canyon felt like a miracle, especially after having zero success in Onemile. There are other creeks listed on the DWR website that hold Yellowstones, but my impression is that they require significantly more effort to reach, or flow mostly through private land. I had a hard time figuring out access points. If I were going back, I would give myself some backup options if neither Onemile nor Sawmill worked. The most obvious seems to be Johnson Creek, which I’ve read recently is a good option, and there have been reports of anglers catching large Yellowstones from that water. It is farther from Clear Creek Campground however, and I don’t know what access is like.\nOne additional note on Utah’s slam. Unlike every other state slam, completing the Utah slam is not free; it requires paying a fee of $20. The money is used to fund conservation projects for fish, and Utah DNR trumpets the projects they’ve compeleted with the money. I have mixed feelings about charging. I worry the fee will exclude or dissuade people who would otherwise complete the challenge, but raising money for conservation projects is undoubtedly beneficial. If we’re honest about the socio-economic status of most people who are fly fishing, I doubt the $20 is making much of a difference in whether someone decides to complete the slam. On balance then, it seems like a good idea, and other states should probably implement a similar fee.\nBack to Main Page"

Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows that the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com.

    "text": "Unlike the Utah Slam, which I did over the course of a summer, I attempted the Wyoming Slam over the course of a few days. It didn’t work, and I had to make a second trip to Wyoming to complete the slam, but because I don’t live in Wyoming, I initially wanted to minimize driving back-and-forth. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about this approach. I definitely felt rushed the whole trip, and it felt like I was doing more driving than fishing. On the other hand, I knocked out three of the four fish I needed in about five days, including the fish farthest from my house that I wanted to avoid having to drive back for. When I had a free weekend near the end of summer, I drove back to Wyoming to target one fish, and it was one of the closest to my house. I wouldn’t want to fish this way again, but for most of us who don’t live in western Wyoming, trying to complete the slam in a week or so is the most viable option.\nDespite the long driving distances, I thought it would be easier than the Utah slam; Wyoming has more options for each fish, bigger water (less brush), and at the time, had more resources online to help plan a fishing trip. Wyoming has a program called “Instream Flow” that provides helpful information on lots of different rivers and creeks, and a related program called “XStream Angler” in which you receive a hat if you a take a picture of yourself near three qualifying rivers or creeks. This is an easy thing to complete when you do your slam as most waters fished in the slam are also considered “instream flow” rivers. When I did the slam a few years ago, I think they required pictures near seven rivers, but perhaps that was too demanding for most people.\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hobble Creek\nBonneville Cutts are found in rivers that flow into the Great Basin. Utah further separates species into Bear River and Bonneville, while Wyoming makes no such distinct. I don’t know what the scientific case is for calling the Bear River and Bonneville separate species, and I suspect Utah does it because they can’t have a fish slam with only three species. Regardless, Hobble Creek flows into the Bear River via the Smiths Fork from the Wyoming Range outside of Cokeville, Wyoming. It’s only about an hour and a half from my home in Cache Valley, Utah so this was the first place I started. I’ve now done quite a bit of hiking, camping, and fishing in the Wyoming Range and adjacent Salt River Range, both of which are incredibly underrated.\nMy driving plan was somewhat convoluted, and in retrospect, I did not do this correctly. Once I’d caught the Bonneville, I planned to go up a road that follows the Smiths Fork north, take that up and over to the Tri-Basin divide, fish for the Colorado River Cutthroat in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to fish for Snake River cutthroat. This didn’t work because the road up Smiths Fork to connect with the Tri-Basin divide slowly deteriorated as we drove up it. Eventually, we came to a spot where the road turned into a giant mud puddle and though it looked like I might be able to get my truck through it, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and turned around. I once got stuck in mud on a dirt road in Kansas, and that experience scarred me so deeply I have become extremely risk averse with muddy roads. Unfortunately, this meant going all the way back out to Cokeville and driving around the southern end of the Wyoming Range. It also changed the creeks I would fish, which ended up having significant consequences.\nHobble Creek is reached by a long drive on relatively good forest roads up until the last mile or so when there is a creek crossing. High clearance vehicles without four-wheel drive should have no problem but I wouldn’t take a sedan across the creek. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a spot for dispersed camping at the crossing that I could see, so it’s important to get to the campground farther down the road. There is also a parking lot for Lake Alice, which is about a two mile hike from the campground, a nice sidetrip with an interesting geological history. This area is used quite a bit by locals visiting the lake on daytrips, but there was only one other site taken in the campground. I think the creek receives a moderate amount of pressure farther downstream as I’ve seen a few people fishing it the times I’ve been up there.\n Into a big brown on Hobble Creek.\nAlice Creek, which flows out of Lake Alice, comes into Hobble right at the campground, and the flow is greater after their confluence. When you first enter Hobble Creek canyon on the forest road, before the campground, Coantag Creek joins up with Hobble Creek and also significantly increases the flow into Hobble. I think most people fish from this point downstream because it’s a bigger creek so they assume it holds bigger fish, and it’s the closest road access for people who drive up for the day.\nI’ve only fished upstream from Coantag Creek, on Hobble Creek up to Alice Creek, then above Alice Creek. Besides the increased pressure, the problem with fishing downstream of Coantag Creek is that it if you stay in the campground, you’d likely have to get back in your car and drive downstream approximately a mile or two to get back to this water. That didn’t make much sense to me so I just walked down the road to get downstream of the campground then fished back up to it. I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I can promise there are very large fish, both cutts and browns, upstream of Coantag Creek near the campground.\nWhen I was fishing for the slam, it was my first time fishing Hobble. On the Logan, my “home river,” there is a fish in every soft spot on the river, almost behind every rock. Because that was what I was used to, and I didn’t have a lot of experience fishing other rivers, I expected to have higher catch rates in Hobble Creek. In fact, when we arrived at the campground in the late afternoon, I walked upstream of the campground and found a nice hole with an undercut bank. Almost immediately, I hooked into a large fish that ended up being a brown. I wasn’t expecting brown trout in Hobble Creek as I thought it was all cutthroat, so though it was a 15 inch plus fish, it didn’t count for the slam. That first fish fooled me because I thought the fishing was going to be easy but I had a more difficult time catching a cutthroat the next morning.\nI wasted a lot of time fishing spots that in retrospect weren’t likely to hold fish. Eventually, I caught exactly one cutthroat and a few additional browns, and had my first fish of the Wyoming slam. Hobble Creek has since become one of my favorite fishing and camping spots, and I’ve subsequently caught very large (nearly 20 inch) cutthroats in the creek, though there are perhaps not as many fish as I would expect given how good the water looks.\nOn that first trip, the large brown I caught made for a delicious dinner. I usually practice catch and release, and I would never keep a cutthroat in a native drainage, but I view browns in these drainages as an invasive species so I sometimes eat them.\n Catch and cook.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Attempt Number 1, Various Creeks\nAs I described above, an attempt to take the road which parallels the Smiths Fork over to Tri-Basin Divide didn’t work as the road was impassable. I was worried this was going to happen and it added hours of driving. Smiths Fork above Cokeville, near the turnoff to the road to Hobble Creek, is a large-ish river that is supposed to have very good fishing. However, access is a bit of a problem as most of the river is private, and there is nowhere to camp nearby. This could be an option for the Bonneville if one wanted to stay in a hotel near Cokeville, though I believe the Smiths Fork also has browns in it. I chose Hobble Creek because it offered convenient camping. I later fished the Smiths Fork up much higher, closer to the Tri-Basin divide, which has much better forest road access (the road I was attempting to connect to) and flows through public land. There is abundant and excellent dispersed camping in this area, but surprisingly, the fishing wasn’t very good for me over two nights of camping. I caught a few fish here and there but really struggled. I’ve only fished it that one time so I’m not sure if that was bad technique on my part or if the fishing really isn’t that great.\nThe vast majority of people attempting the slam center their efforts on Tri-Basin divide. One can catch the Bonneville in upper Smiths Fork, drive a very short way to catch the Colorado River in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to catch the Snake River. All three of these fish exist within maybe a five mile radius. Because I couldn’t connect up to Tri-Basin, I drove around the southern end of the Wyoming Range to fish the creeks coming off the east side of the range, then connected over to the Greys on forest roads via McDougal Gap. Again, literally every Wyoming Cutt Slam report online says to fish LaBarge Creek, but I didn’t want to have to drive up LaBarge Creek road then down Greys River road as I thought that would add significant time, and there aren’t any campgrounds on LaBarge Creek or in the Tri-Basin area. Because the Wyoming Fish and Game lists a number of creeks on the east side of the Wyoming Range that hold cutts, I thought I would just fish these. The night after leaving Hobble, we camped at Sacajawea Campground which is located on Middle Piney Creek.\n Middle Piney creek near Sacajawea Campground. Small, but should have given more effort. The smoke started moving in.\nSacajawea is another amazing, nearly deserted forest service campground in Wyoming that should be crowded. Unfortunately, Middle Piney Creek was tiny and my brief efforts to fish on evening arrival didn’t yield anything. Here is where feeling time pressured got to me. Instead of giving Middle Piney a real chance, the next day we decided to begin heading to Greys River Road and fish along the way as the drive over to the Greys would cross a number of creeks. Before I complain about the fishing, I will say the scenery on this drive is spectacular.\nThe first stop was North Piney Creek. The fishing was slow but I did manage to catch a brook trout, which was not helpful. The second stop was North Cottonwood Creek, which is on the forest road which goes over McDougal Gap. After about an hour of fishing unsuccessfully, I finally caught a small brook trout. This was very frustrating, and out of ideas, I gave up and we drove over McDougal Gap to the Greys River.\n North Piney Creek. Looks good, caught nothing but a few brooks.\n Same story on North Cottonwood.\n Driving between basins on east side of Wyoming Range.\n\n\nSnake River Cutthroat–Greys River\nThe Greys River forms in the Tri-Basin divide and Greys River Road runs its entire length, from there to Alpine, WY where the Greys meets the Snake in Palisades Resevoir. The road is well maintained and well traveled, and while this area isn’t exactly deserted, its not so crowded as to be unpleasant. The scenery is spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be very good as well. We stayed in Forest Park Campground which is just upriver from where the forest road over McDougal Gap meets Greys River Road. Forest Park was also mostly empty, though a lot of people prefer to disperse camp along the Greys River.\n Over McDougal Gap into Greys River drainage, forest road at bottom left. It had been smoky all day.\nI eventually caught my Snake River cutt in the Greys. It was not spectacular fishing in terms of catch rate or size, but the surroundings made up for much of that. It was very hot when I was there, and nothing really started happening until late in the afternoon. I’d already been fishing for a few hours so I caught maybe three or four medium size cutts and called it. We had a very long drive planned the next day, and I was frustrated after my lack of success fishing for the Colorado River cutt.\nOddly, I’ve never fished the Greys again, despite passing by it a number of times. There isn’t a good reason for that, other than I’ve never really gotten around to it. I would like to drive its entire length from Alpine to Tri-Basin divide. Years later, for my Western Native Trout Challenge, I fished the very top of LaBarge Creek and caught a Colorado River cutt, but didn’t make it down to the Greys. I’d like to determine whether my slow evenings on both the Smiths Fork and Greys River were aberrations or if the fishing is not as good as reports suggest. One other note on Greys River road: when leaving Greys River Road and entering Alpine, a stop at Melvin’s Brewery is mandatory.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Greybull River\nWas the drive from Alpine, though Jackson, Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, out to Cody, and to the Greybull River a frustrating slog through bumper-to-bumper traffic? Yes, and I won’t relive it by elaborating further. I’ve now driven through Yellowstone twice in the summer, and I’m sorry to say it’s just awful.\nOutside of Cody, and closer to Meeteetse, WY, there are quite a few possibilities for the Yellowstone cutthroat. Both the Greybull and Wood River are supposed to have fantastic fishing, and I chose the Greybull because of the forest service campground on the river and because Jack Creek flows into the Greybull at the campground; if the mainstem didn’t work, I would have a backup.\n Sunset over Jack Creek Campground.\nThe road from Meeteetse to Jack Creek Campground, on the Greybull, is long and rough, but as per usual, there was not a single other campsite taken. This is incredible to me given how close it is to the hordes nearby in Yellowstone. The scenery is incredible, the river looks like a classic, western blue-ribbon trout stream, and the grizzly bears are, apparently, plentiful. Jack Creek campground is a place I wanted to stay for a week, and fortunately, the fishing lived up to its promise.\nThis was by far, the most enjoyable experience of the whole trip. The evening we arrived, I fished the river almost behind my campsite and immediately caught a few nice cutthroat. There were fish rising everywhere, and it’s clear the river doesn’t see a lot of pressure. The next morning I fished again, and again caught quite a few fish. The Greybull is extremely slick to wade, and I kept an eye out for grizzlies, but the fishing was amazing. My catch rate was high, the average fish size was probably about 12 inches, with a few pushing 15. These fishing experiences are so enjoyable, but they make for a short story: arrived, got a nice campsite, and caught a lot of fish in beautiful scenery.\n Greybull River in the morning.\n\n\nColorado River Cutthroat–Attempt Number 2, North Cottonwood Creek\nI went back to the eastern slope of the Wyoming Range in mid-September, after my summer trip. And, just like my summer trip, I made the mistake of not going to LaBarge Creek. The reason for this is that we wanted to do a backpacking trip, and there is no backpacking along LaBarge Creek, only driving. Instead, I decided we would hike up North Piney Creek, and I assumed, like the Utah rivers I’m familiar with, that increasing elevation would increase the cutthroat to non-cutthroat ratio.\n The east slope of the Wyoming Range in fall.\nWe only had a weekend, and work delays meant we left too late on Friday. We arrived at the North Piney Creek trailhead too late in the day to get very far up the river, though I met a guy coming down the trail who had fished. He assured me he caught some cutthroats, though also gave me an ominious warning about the start of hunting season. It turned out that after hiking up the trail about two miles, we hiked directly into hunters who parked at a higher trailhead reachable on a quad or side-by-side. In other words, by going up the drainage away from the main road, we actually hiked into the crowds. We inadvertently setup camp nearly in the dark very close to a staging area. This meant we woke up at about five a.m. to the sound of quads and hunters talking. Not a great camping experience!\nI managed to fish for a few minutes before it got too dark and caught lots of fish. Unfortunately, they were all five inch brook trout. It’s my understanding that back East a lot of people pursue brookies and view them with reverance, but I absolutely loathe them. They don’t belong in the West, they never get very big in western rivers, and there always seem to be a million of them when trying to catch a native fish.\nThe next morning we hiked farther up North Piney Creek, but the water got very small very quickly, and I didn’t have much fishing success. The number of hunters and off-road vehicles was a legitimate issue too as it was a total zoo in the area. I also hunt and have no moral objection to it, though I get annoyed with the use of gas-powered vehicles to cover ground in the backcountry. We decided to hike out and try our luck elsewhere. Hilariously, almost at the trailhead where we parked, and below where all the hunters drove onto the trail, there was a bull elk bugling like crazy from some pine trees.\nWe drove from North Piney to North Cottonwood. As in the summer, my plan was to use the road along North Cottonwood to connect over to Greys River Road, then out to Alpine, and back to Cache Valley. I was also hoping that because the creek was right along a road there would be fewer hunters. That was a poor assumption. Nearly every plausible dispersed campsite was taken and we were forced to camp in what was essentially a turnout along the road. The good news is that I had all day to catch at least one cutthroat from North Cottonwood Creek, which the Wyoming Game and Fish says is “one of the state’s finest fly-fishing streams,” and one in which Colorado River cutthroat are “common.”\nIt is definitely full of brook trout. For hours I caught dozens of them. As usual, the average size was about eight inches and it’s just not very satisfying fishing. It was getting dark and I was getting frustrated. I began to suspect that the cutthroat were deeper in the water column but I really wanted to use a dry fly to catch one. But, every cast on top of the water just brought up brooks. This is an experience I’ve had in a number of places with small but aggressive fish attacking the surface, but larger fish remaining deeper. Eventually, I think I just got lucky. I cast to an undercut bank and my dry fly got sucked under the surface, maybe only a foot, if that. I hooked a fish and it immediately looked different. I had caught my Colorado River cutt.\nWere I to do this experience today, I would pretty quickly switch to a dry-dropper, or even just a pure nymph setup. At the time, I didn’t really use nymphs or dropper setups effectively, and was really stuck on trying to fish exclusively with drys. I’ve also gotten better at using a dry similar to a wet fly by allowing it to sink. This is most effective on very small creeks by allowing the dry to float through the whitewater and go under into a hole. I’ve even begun tying my version of a wet fly doing something like an Adams, but without any hackle to allow it to better sink. When fishing with it, I don’t add any floatant and after it soaks, the fly will start to sink a little, especially when it encounters whitewater or riffles. This can be very effective at getting the fly just deep enough to entice a trout sitting at the bottom of a hole on a small creek. The trout still needs to move up, so it isn’t the same as nymphing where one attempts to get the fly all the way down to the fish, but I think it simulates a floating bug that may have just gotten sucked underneath the current a bit. North Cottonwood may be slightly too big of water to do this a lot, but I could imagine allowing a fly to sink just six inches or so under an undercut bank. In fact, this is almost exactly how I caught my cutt, though it wasn’t purposeful when I did it then. Does this count as dry fly fishing? Not really, but I can say I caught all my Wyoming fish, as with all my Utah fish, on dry flies, even if they were not always floating.\n Over McDougal Gap in September. Compare this picture without smoke to the one above.\n\n\nSummary\nPerhaps part of the reason why the Greybull was so enjoyable is that once I caught my fish the evening we arrived, the pressure was off. It was the last stop before I went home, and I had caught three of the four. Again, the lesson (for me, anyway) seems to be not to rush things. I wish I could have stayed longer at each spot and really learned the river or creek. As I mentioned, I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I’ve had some amazing experiences on that water because I’ve been able to explore it more and understand the fish in the creek better. When fishing for an evening or morning on the way to the next spot, one doesn’t get to unlock the fishing on a particular water at all.\nOn the other hand, most of us have jobs, families, regular lives to live, and we can’t spend three or four days in one spot if we’re trying to finish the slam. Perhaps two full nights at each spot is optimal, but that means eight nights, not including driving days. And, if catching a particular species isn’t successful, then one has to decide pretty quickly whether they are going to move on, or burn all their time working on one fish.\nThe Wyoming slam was the first slam and remains the most famous for a reason. The driving was a hassle, especially through Yellowstone at the height of summer. I had done it a few years before and promised myself never again, then I did it again. This time, I really won’t do it again. But, Western Wyoming is an amazing place and there is so much to do and see besides Teton and Yellowstone. My trip didn’t even touch the Bighorns or Wind River range. I would love to go back to the Meeteetse area and fish the Greybull again, but also the Wood and the smaller creeks in that area. It’s rumored that Fenn’s Treasure was hidden in the Wood River drainage, though recent reports suggest it was in Yellowstone National Park which is to the west of the Shoshone National Forest, where most of the Greybull and Wood River drainages are located.\nPerhaps because I live in Utah, the Wyoming slam felt bigger, more interesting, and more classically “western.” There weren’t any tiny, brushy creeks on this trip, and though I didn’t go to any of the really famous Wyoming waters, the fishing was mostly very good. These are big, but not too big rivers, pressure is light, campgrounds are quiet, and the scenery is excellent.\nIn some ways the Wyoming Cutt Slam is easier than the Utah one because the fishing is probably a little more straightforward, with the exception of the Colorado River Cutt. I think LaBarge Creek is the obvious place to go now, though I’ve read reports online that it can sometimes be difficult fishing. I fished it in the Tri-Basin Divide once, after I’d completed my slam, and I caught some small cutts without too much difficulty.\nThe Bonneville could also be a little tricky if the Smiths Fork or Hobble Creek don’t work, and in both of those you’ll have to fight through the browns, and possibly rainbows or brooks. I know nothing about the other creeks listed on the Fish and Game’s website, but when researching this trip, they didn’t seem like good options for one reason or another.\nThe logistics in Wyoming are more difficult than Utah however, and if for some reason you struck out on a particular river and had to come back, it’s likely going to be a lot of travel time. I also got relatively lucky with the weather, with the only real challenge coming on the Greys where it was very hot. The air quality in the Wyoming Range was not great due to smoke, but fly fishing is not aerobic so it wasn’t a big deal other than obscuring some of the scenery. Summers in the West are increasingly unpredictable and very hot weather, fires, smoke, or heavy rain can derail plans. For these reasons, I think Utah is still probably the easier first cutt slam to attempt, but it’s close between the two.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "Rock Creek, near Logan, UT.\nI haven’t been fly fishing for that long; I grew up in Southern California which is not exactly a hotbed of trout fishing. I occassionally rod-and-reel fished when camping in the Sierras and in school at the University of Colorado. It was only when I moved to Utah in 2016 that I began serious fly fishing. It helps that I had a skilled mentor who taught me his style. My first summer of fly fishing, I mostly didn’t catch a thing, and I got so frustrated I kind of gave up one it.\nUtah introduced it’s Cutt Slam shortly after I improved as an angler, and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. it forced me to learn more about the fish, explore waters I normally wouldn’t fish, and challenge myself by learning new techniques to tackle new waters.\nWhile I extensively researched the places where I’d try to catch fish for my challenge, I was frustrated with the information on the internet. I found most websites to be full of fish pictures and short on details. This made things difficult for me because I was unsure how to prepare, what kinds of flies to use (though I think this is largely overrated), what kind of water I’d be fishing, in some cases where or how to access the streams. Most importantly, I wanted to have a good experience: good fishing with small crowds, nice scenery, etc. As a result, this site is short on pictures but I hope, long on details. For most of us, it isn’t feasible to drive four hours to a fishing spot and not be successful. I think a lot of the websites suggest that potential anglers have unlimited time and money to catch fish. I also don’t show fish pictures that often,and mostly focus on the water and scenery. When researching my own slams I wanted to know what the water looked like to get a sense of size, type, etc. I know what fish look like.\nA summary of my completed and in progress slams can be found here. I provide details on where and how I caught my fish."

    "text": "I have completed two slams and am working on two more. I debate whether the Wyoming or Utah slam is easier to complete, but I am absolutely certain about which one is the most difficult. Nevada has it all–long driving distances, small, brushy creeks, difficult to find and catch fish, and unlike Utah and Wyoming which require catching four fish, Nevada has six(!) in its slam. I have not completed the Nevada slam, and according to their angler recognition program, fewer than 30 people have ever completed it in the ten years or so it’s been around. I have caught three of the six, and it is just very, very difficult. But in my mind, this also makes it the most interesting and impressive!\nOf the three fish I’ve caught, the first took me almost a full day and a half of fishing in the middle of nowhere, the second felt like an absolute miracle, and third required a backpack into the mountains to get to the fish. Nevada also refers to their contest as a “fish slam” rather than a “trout slam” because two of the fish are not trout. Bull trout is characterized as a char, while mountain whitefish is a different kind of salmonid. I admittedly don’t understand enough about fish biology to know the differences between these species.\nAt the time I started my slam, Nevada provided significantly less information on waters to find native fish than either Wyoming or Utah. They have since improved, but in 2019 it was literally a typed list of waters. I had to sort of cross-reference the list with accessible waters, what they looked like, how fishable they were likely to be, and what access was like. I was concerned about high levels of brush and impassable roads. One resource I have found to be helpful is Nevada’s annual Trophy Fish book, which can be found via the webpage here. The book lists people who have completed the slam each year and, importantly, where they caught their fish. Though the book changes every year, I was able to access old copies by editing the url. I used the waters frequently mentioned in the book to target my search.\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hendry’s Creek\nAs with my two previous slams, the Bonneville was the first fish I caught in Nevada. The fish exists in a few isolated mountain streams on the east side of the state, and while it wasn’t a short drive for me to get to the Great Basin National Park area, this was about the closest, easily catcheable fish. The Yellowstone is closer to me, but I hadn’t figured out how I was going to catch it yet. I also happened to be camping in central Utah, so I decided to make a one night detour out to Nevada.\nThe mountains in Nevada are unique because they tend to be long, narrow and rise steeply up from the Great Basin. Nevada is the dryest state in the country due to rain-shadowing from the Sierra Nevada, but it’s amazing how quickly the scenery can change with a little elevation. Utah is not too different, but the mountains tend to be a little bigger and a little wider, not giving the same overall feeling that Nevada mountains do of being “sky islands”. The Great Basin, especially in the northern part of the state, looks unlike almost anywhere else I’ve been in the world.\nThe amazing thing to me about the Bonneville trout in Nevada is that the streams disappear into the desert when they come out of the mountains. The fish traveled up these creeks as Lake Bonneville shrunk, then disappeared, and they’ve been there ever since, living in just a few miles of tiny creeks.\nHendry’s Creek is perhaps the easiest creek to access to catch the Bonneville as its accessible by a mostly okay forest road with dispersed camping nearby. One may also fish the creeks in the national park itself, but I’d been to Great Basin before and didn’t want to pay the entrance fee, and worry about finding a campsite. Some of the best target waters in the park had burned recently as well. It also seemed like Hendry’s Creek was almost a sure thing. One of the reports I read online suggested the guy rolled up to the creek, got out of his truck, caught his fish and left. I did not have the same success.\nThere is an obvious parking area at the end of the forest road very near the creek. The forest road itself is barely passable with a high-clearance two wheel drive vehicle. The creek near the parking area is small, but not particularly brushy and made for relatively easy casting. Unfortunately, there was no evidence fish existed in the creek. I didn’t bring a fish up, didn’t see a fish, and certainly didn’t hook a fish. I walked upstream, as I always do, and had no success. My original plan was to catch the fish and drive home, but it became clear that I’d have to stay another night. I found one of the dispersed campsites and setup there, with one another site just below me also taken, though I don’t think the area sees a lot of traffic.\n Start of the trail up Hendry’s Creek.\nIn fly fishing, like many things, when in doubt, go higher. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t, but I believe it works, so it’s one of my go-to moves if I’m not catching fish. After not catching anything the night before, and thinking that perhaps the fish had moved higher up the creek because it was June and too warm down low, I got on my mountain bike and rode up the trail to the wilderness boundary. Bikes are not allowed in wilderness areas (though horses are, which makes no sense to me), so I walked from there. One of the issues with Hendry’s is that the ditch in which the creek runs is quite steep and brushy, so in many places it isn’t that easy to access the creek. From above, you can also look down into the creek and presumably see fish, if there were any there. I saw no fish.\n There is a creek with fish in there somewhere.\nDespite this, I decided at basically a random spot that I was high enough and I should start fishing. Spots were few and far between but I got down into the creek and dapped or flipped my fly into a few holes. After maybe an hour of this, I hooked a fish and almost immediately lost it, giving me flashbacks to Onemile Creek. I can often tell when a fish isn’t hooked well and I tried to be gentle, but it came off. This is a common occurrence fly fishing, and even though you only have to catch one fish to count for a slam, you often end up “catching” more because you lose a few. It’s frustrating but part of the deal. But, at least there were fish somewhere in the creek.\nI fished on and on, and finally hooked another. I was beginning to get worried, and because I lost the first fish, I aggressively flung the second fish nearly onto the trail. This was not easy fishing, and I’m not sure how quickly others have caught their fish in Hendry’s, but I struggled. Getting in and out of the little drainage to get around brush was tough, finding holes to dap into was tough, and catching the fish was tough. In fact, identifying holes where there might be a fish was easy, but getting to the hole and actually catching the fish was a struggle. I stopped fishing almost immediately after I had my fish. The scenery was fine, as the mountains had some nice red rocks and pine trees higher up the trail.\n My fish came out of this hole, which was approximately six inches across and three inches deep.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 1\nMost people completing the Nevada slam will come from the west side of the state because that is where the population centers are. For them, the Lahontan will be easier because it is native to drainages that flow toward or near the west side of the state. Unfortunately for me, it is more difficult to access the Lahontan from the east side as one inevitably has to drive across half the state to access waters it seems more difficult to catch as compared to the western rivers such as the Truckee. For most people then, my situation will not apply because the obvious answer is just to fish the Truckee in Reno.\nI dislike driving long distances so I sought the water farthest to the east that holds Lahontans and settled on the Marys River which flows out of the Jarbidge Mountains toward the Humboldt River east of Elko. This was a mistake. Had I gone farther, to the Elko area, there are creeks with Lahontans that flow off the east side of the Independence Mountain Range, and one in particular, Gance Creek, shows up in a lot of articles as an easy place to catch them. But, because I tried to save myself some driving time, I drove north from the 80 onto a dirt road for almost 40 miles. Outside of Wells it starts as Metropolis Road and passes the abandoned mining town of Metropolis, then continues on as Deeth-O’Neil County Road. The town of Metropolis is worth a stop, and the plaque explains that it died from a combination of getting cut off from its water supply, and a plague of jackrabbits and mormon crickets.\nAt the turnoff from Deeth-O’Neil Road, I had to cross the river on a bridge, go up and over a hill, across a plateau, then over another small ridge, and drop back down to the river miles upstream. The road was well-maintained until the plateau section, and where it drops back down to the river. It is very steep, with some small, muddy creek crossings. I would only attempt this drive in a high-clearance vehicle, and though I did it with two wheel drive, it seemed iffy. Once at the river, there are a number of nice dispersed campsites. The area is somewhat well-used but the night I was there, only one other group was camping well away from us.\n Near lower Marys River. There were no trout here but the scenery was nice.\nThe Marys River in this area looked fishable. I was worried there wouldn’t be enough water as I was there in early September, but the river was bigger than I thought. It looked a little stagnant in places, but I didn’t see any reason why there wouldn’t be trout. To make a long story short, there weren’t any trout in the river. I fished without success, spent the night, and faced a decision. Should I continue looking for trout, or move on to another creek? T Creek was on the same road I came in on, and also is supposed to hold Lahontan, so I thought I’d try that. That also proved to be futile, and it was much harder fishing because it was so small and brushy. It occurred to me to go higher, but I wasn’t sure how much higher I had to go, and this was a brief weekend trip so I was facing some time pressure. On my way back to Utah, I wanted to stop in the northeast corner of Nevada and try to catch a Yellowstone.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Goose Creek\nI abandoned the search for a Lahonton and made the decision to head toward Goose Creek. This was another long drive out, through the town of Jackpot for gas, then across another set of dirt roads to the Goose Creek area. As the Nevada DWF makes a point of saying, the Yellowstone will likely be the hardest fish to catch because it exists in only a few creeks and they are all on private land. I really didn’t want to figure out how to ask for permission, so I had a strategy. The first creek I would come across on the road was Little Goose Creek, and using Caltopo and OnX, it looked like there might be some public access to the water. Then, if I could cross a small piece of private, I could access a small canyon through which Little Goose flowed and was entirely public.\nLittle Goose Creek crosses the road at an intersection of two well maintained dirt roads. The creek was small but not brushy and looked somewhat deep. I was hoping I’d get lucky here, catch the fish in a few minutes and be able to leave. I began walking up Little Goose, casting my dry fly, but having no success. I’m pretty sure this was public land but very quickly, I came to posted private land that I wasn’t willing to cross, so that was that for Little Goose Creek. I got back in my truck and headed toward Trout Creek.\nI had read that this entire area belonged to one family with a few ranches. I’d also read a report online of another angler saying they caught their Yellowstone in Trout Creek, which flows into Goose Creek. That angler reported using a dispersed campsite made available by the ranch on Trout Creek. That is where I was headed, though I was somewhat apprehensive about using a campsite supposedly available to the public. As I turned onto the road up Trout Creek, I was greeted with this sign.\n A very warm welcome to anglers!\nSo, was I allowed to fish on Trout Creek or not? It would be easy to deny I was an environmentalist if questioned, but the top sign indicates sportsmen are welcome, while the bottom sign indicates they are not. I remained apprehensive, but sure enough, a few miles up Trout Creek road was what looked to be a campsite. We stopped there, and I drove up higher on the creek to fish that evening. I tried to drive as high as I could, but eventually the road disintegrated to such a point that I started fishing and walking up river. There was no evidence of fish, though a bull elk was bugling very close to where I was fishing.\n Trout Creek did not live up to its name.\nThe area has surprisingly nice scenery, looking like a mix between high desert and pine forest. That night I tried to decide whether I should go up even higher on Trout Creek or head over to Goose Creek, the main water in which Yellowstones inhabit in Nevada. Given my complete lack of success on Trout Creek, and the fact that I needed to start driving home, we decided to head to Goose Creek. How I was going to fish it was unclear because it is, apparently, all on private property, though it does flow under the road and I was hoping I could just fish off the road.\nThis is where things get interesting. The next morning we drove out, toward Utah and Goose Creek. At a large meadow, the creek flows under the road. I stopped and tried to decide what to do. There was nothing posted that indicated it was private property, and I considered simply walking down to the creek and fishing. I started setting up my rod and immediately saw a cloud of dust on the road in the distance. Was it possible someone was coming to intercept me? I saw that it was a guy in side-by-side with dogs herding cattle. I jumped in my truck and drove down the road to meet him. Our conservation was as follows: “Hey, is this your land?” He looked at me suspiciously and said, “yep.” “Do you mind if I fish in the creek?” His response seemed to indicate that I was out of my mind. “Uh, I guess you can, just watch out for the cattle, I’ll be moving them over there.” In fact, he seemed so skeptical I wondered what the deal was and asked, “Am I the first person to ask you to fish here?” He said, “no, there have been others every once in awhile.” What was going on here, why was he acting like I was crazy? “Are there fish in there?” His response: “I don’t know.” Oh okay, cool, the rancher doesn’t know if there are fish in his creek.\n Goose Creek does not look like a classic trout stream.\nGoose Creek is possibly the worst looking “trout” stream I’ve seen. It was muddy, the banks had been destroyed by cows, there were pies everywhere, and not a tree in sight. It must have been broiling in the summer. To be fair, it had just rained, so maybe the creek was just blown out, but I think it was the cows. I thought, this is completely futile, there is no way I’m going to catch a fish here.\nI immediately realized a dry wasn’t going to work, so I used a dry dropper, which is almost always how I nymph. Of course, there were no signs of life for about the first half hour or so. It really did seem pointless. The rancher came back at one point and asked me if I caught anything. He turned out to be a nice guy despite being baffled that someone would want to fish Goose Creek. I told him no, he laughed and wished me luck, and drove off in his side-by-side.\nIncredibly, shortly after, I felt a fish on my nymph and nearly lost my mind. I couldn’t see the fish until it was almost on the bank because it was so muddy, and at first I thought it was a whitefish it was so pale. It was a large cutthroat, something like 15 inches. I can’t believe a fish that big can survive in that water. I really wish I could tell the rancher that there are indeed large fish in his creek, but I didn’t see him again.\n Yellowstone trout and cow pie from Goose Creek.\nI have no idea how I pulled that off, and I suspect I could spend another week there and not catch another fish. I’m not sure what advice to offer to others. NDOW offers the not terribly helpful advice to ask for permission to fish on Goose Creek at one of the ranch houses. I didn’t see any ranch houses anywhere near the road as everything seemed to be fenced off. In other words, had I not run across the rancher in his side-by-side, I don’t know how I would have asked for permission. I interpret the sign and campsite on Trout Creek as providing permission to fish that water, but I couldn’t catch a fish there. I’m guessing I was maybe two or three miles from the Idaho border, so the fish might just be up higher. Or perhaps, I just needed to fish it longer. It looks like parts of Trout Creek lie on public land very close to the Idaho border. An app like OnX would help immensely as when I was fishing it I couldn’t determine where I was in relation to the public land or the border. The best option, absent asking permission, might be to fish Little Goose Creek for the stretch on which it flows through public land. Maps like CalTopo show public land access to a portion of the creek off the road.\nIn short, I’m glad I don’t have to catch a second Yellowstone cutt in Nevada.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 2\nNevada has some odd bureaucratic requirements for completing the slam. First, they used to require the angler take a picture with their fish. This requirement seems to have vanished from their updated webpages. Second, the angler must print off their form for each fish as they catch it, then mail it to NDOW with the picture. I received an email confirming my submission, and after submitting my Yellowstone, another emailed confirmation from an NDOW employee and a compliment on my fish. I emailed back and told him about striking out on the Marys. His response indicated that the trout are up much higher, which I took to mean the Jarbidge Mountains, the source of the Marys.\nThe Jarbidge Mountains are an undiscovered jem. The Marys River flows out of a drainage on the south side of the mountains, into the Humboldt River and Great Basin, while the Jarbidge River flows off the north side, toward the Snake River, and eventually into the Columbia and to the Pacific. The Jarbidge River is home to bull trout and redband, two of which are required for the Nevada slam, and neither of which I have yet caught. My goal on this trip was the Lahontan.\n The Jarbidge Mountains are a spectacular slice of northern Nevada.\nTo get to the Marys River headwaters, we backpacked in from the Camp Draw trailhead. The forest road coming from the south is good, and connects over the mountains into the town of Jarbidge on the north side of the range. We were there in June, shortly after a late season storm, and the road was wet and muddy in places, but passable. In dry weather, it should be no problem even for sedans. The backpack down to the Marys was fairly short and easy, and we saw two different herds of elk in the mountains. Unsurprisingly, over a three night backpack, we saw no one else in the mountains or at the parking lot.\n We spooked a herd of cow and calf elk.\nWe found an already established campsite right along the river, and I fished only very briefly in the evening. The Marys River was more like a creek here and though parts of it were brushy, most of it looked like good water. There were overhanging branches, some deep pools, and soft spots in the river. It looked like I should easily catch a few fish, except I didn’t. Even when I’m not catching fish, I can usually see evidence of them, like feeding at the surface or fish spooking as I wade upstream. If I don’t see any fish darting away from me as I wade, I get concerned, and I didn’t see anything as I worked upstream. The next morning I decided to hike upstream farther and get higher, though I was already in the headwaters. The most surprising thing about this campsite is that there were a lot of ticks near the river. (Ticks in Nevada, who knew!)\nThe next morning I hiked upstream and as the trail parallels the river, it was easy to look for likely fishing spots. At one spot, amidst the downfall, I could see fish. Finally, the Lahontan in the Marys River! Unless they were brook trout. It was tough getting down to the river, and there was a lot of deadfall which prevented easy wading. I worried that I would only get a few casts before the fish I saw spooked, so I needed to make them count. Sure enough, after about two or three casts, I hooked my Lahonton.\nI was with other people who were more interested in backpacking than watching me fish, so I stopped fishing after that. I also had another goal in mind. If we continued on that trail, we could go up and over a pass, leave the Marys River drainage and enter the Jarbidge River drainage. There I could attempt to catch either a bull trout or redband and bag another fish for my Nevada slam, though if I didn’t get both I’d have to come back to the area anyway.\n Looking down into the Jarbidge River drainage.\nThe hiking was fairly easy to get over the pass, though the north facing slope, down into the Jarbidge River drainage, was still holding quite a bit of snow. We made it a few miles down the Jarbidge River and I tried to do some fishing, but it was still running high and fast, and the gradient was extremely steep. This made it difficult to find holes, and I think I needed to hike lower to find suitable fishing spots. We didn’t do this because we were running out of daylight, and every mile farther down we hiked would be another mile we’d have to hike back up and out. I didn’t catch either a redband or a bull trout, but the Marys River Lahontan has me with three of the six fish needed for the Nevada Native Trout Challenge. I’m not sure if I’ll get to Jarbidge in 2023 as I plan on spending significant time in California completing that state’s challenge. I do plan on targeting a whitefish in the western part of the state in the summer of 2023, however.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "California is my home state and the place where I first learned to rod-and-reel fish. I made semi-annual camping trips with my family into the Sierra, and sometimes caught fish, which we almost always kept and ate. Some of the best fishing experiences I ever had were in the Kennedy Meadows of the Southern Sierra, fishing the South Fork of the Kern. I also had family in the Kernville area, and fished the Kern a number of times growing up, though I can’t remember having much success on that river.\nI am just beginning my California Heritage Trout Challenge, and I’m excited to make some serious progress this coming summer. Because California has high state capacity and a professionalized legislature, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has published a very fancy, glossy brochure that discusses each fish and where to find them. The brochure somewhat confusingly lists twelve total “heritage” trout that exist or existed in California, though anglers only have to catch six to complete the challenge. One of those trout, bull trout, has been extirpated from the state. That leaves eleven.\nA second fish, the Paiute Trout, has a native range comprising a small set of creeks that are currently closed to fishing because the fish is listed under the Endangered Species Act. While anglers can and do catch the fish in other drainages to which they’ve been transported (apparently in the White Mountains), these fish do not qualify for the Heritage Trout Challenge because they are outside their native drainage. The brochure teases that it is possible to catch a Paiute below the closure as some fish apparently wash downstream. I’ve done a lot of research and seen others hint at this possibility, but I don’t know if it’s realistic or not. That seemingly leaves ten total fish.\nEven more confusingly, the brochure lists a second recognition level, that of “Master Angler”, if one catches all eleven species, but that includes the Paiute cutthroat. My impression is that the brochure was published prior to the closure of the Silver Creek drainage, home of the Pauite, so I’m not sure it’s even possible to complete the Master Angler level. References to Master Angler also seem to have been completely scrubbed from any current online sources. My approach will be to catch as many fish as I can to complete the regular challenge and work toward the Master Angler title. Then if I get close, I’ll look into whether it’s even possible to catch a Pauite downstream of the closure. In other words, I’d like to complete the Master Angler level, but I’ll save solving the problem of the Pauite for later. While I expect to finish the regular challenge level this year, I don’t believe I’ll be able to catch all ten in 2023. This puts off the Pauite problem for at least another year. Who knows, maybe Silver Creek will open to fishing in 2024.\nEven though I’ve caught Coastal Rainbows, Kern River Rainbows, and Golden Trout as a child, I’m treating this challenge as a fresh start. I’m not even sure I could locate pictures of me with any of these fish. I was able to catch one fish in 2022, and plan on catching at least five more in the summer of 2023 to complete the first level of the challenge.\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Upper Truckee River\nThe Upper Truckee headwaters are in Meiss Meadows just over a pass from Highway 88 outside of Tahoe. It was a strange experience returning here as I did a backpacking trip to this same area with my father as a teenager in 1998. On that trip, we were trying to get to Showers Lake, and started hiking south from Highway 50. It was a big snow year and we quickly realized we couldn’t make it, so we drove to 88 and tried to hike north. We were blocked by snow again, and backtracked to Meiss Lake and camped there. It was shocking to see how much smaller the lake was in 2022 as compared to 1998.\nMeiss Meadow is a lovely area that’s an easy hike from the highway. The trail crosses the headwaters of the Truckee, but the river here is a little indistinct as it flows through the meadows and picks up water from Meiss Lake and a number of small ponds. We hiked past the river crossing, then ventured off trail down to where I thought the river would be a little narrower and larger. It was still pretty small and somewhat brushy, but there were lots of holes to cast into, and I could immediately see a lot of fish.\n The old Meiss Ranch.\nIt didn’t take long to catch a few Lahontans, and my first qualifying fish for the California Heritage Trout Challenge was in the books. It was a little disconcerting to see how low the water was, especially because it was only mid-July, not that late in the season. It was also disconcerting to see damage from the Caldor Fire at various points along Highway 88 up the canyon. The significant rain and snowfall in the winter of 23 will delay the summer fishing season a bit, but I’m hoping it will temporarily solve some of the water problems in the Sierra.\n Low water on the Upper Truckee in mid-July. Caught a deer unawares.\nMore fish coming, summer 2023.\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "How I Fish",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every angler has their own style, techniques, and preferred ways of doing things. Mine are simply the result of how I learned to fly fish, and adjustments that I’ve made over the years. None of my advice or descriptions are meant to be prescriptive as I’m a big believer in learning to fish your own fish (borrowed from the expression, “hike your own hike”), but I think understanding some basic, fundamental strategies are helpful, especially for new anglers.\n\nFish Upstream\nI fish upstream about 99% of the time. That is, I begin downstream of wherever I think my endpoint will be, and work upstream. If I’m finishing along a road and park in a turnout, I usually fish upstream from my car, then walk back downstream on the road when I’m finished. I do this because I believe most anglers walk downstream from their car, then fish upstream back to their car. If people consistently park in the same turnout, the stretch of water downstream of the car will see more pressure than that upstream, and I always want to fish water with less fishing pressure.\nI fish upstream for a few reasons. First, as the name suggests, I fish with dry flies if at all possible, though this is changing a little bit (see below). I think the “float” or presentation of the dry fly is more natural when you cast upstream and let it float back to you, rather than casting downstream and have it float away from you. Maybe this is only because of my own poor technique fishing downstream, but I feel like trying to feed line as a fly floats downstream just looks less natural.\nSecond, fish almost always face upstream into the current. When you approach downstream, the fish are looking away from you and are less likely to spook. This is probably not as big of an issue on larger rivers, but most of my fishing is done on small rivers and creeks where the fish can easily see you if you get too close to their field of vision. A valid counterpoint to this is that if you cast upstream, the fish see the line, leader, and tippet go over their field of vision before they see the fly. If you cast downstream (and the fish face upstream), they see the fly first. This must be true, but I don’t think the fish care much about seeing line in the water, and I think they care a lot about seeing a person moving around. It’s also the case that often when wading you stir up dirt and debris and this can cause off-color water to move downstream. If you’re fishing upstream this is irrelevant because the fish will never know.\nFinally, if a fish takes the fly and you’re downstream of the fish, when you set the fly you are setting it back into the fish’s mouth which produces a better hook set and makes it more likely you land the fish. If you’re fishing downstream, setting the hook pulls the fly away from the fish’s mouth and toward the angler, increasing the chances you’ll simply pull the fly out of the fish’s mouth.\nAlso, it’s harder to net a fish by bringing it upstream to you because you’re fighting the current, which makes it more likely you’ll break your trippet. Easier to bring it downstream toward you.\nThe only exception to my fishing upstream rule is when I use a streamer. My streamer technique is standard and basic: I cast across and down, or just down if the water is narrow, and pull the line back toward me by hand (without reeling in). I almost never fish this way however, because I stink at this technique. I’m sure I’ve caught fewer than five trout on a streamer.\n\n\nCast Short\nThe vast majority of my fishing is done on small and medium size waters. The Logan is the biggest river I normally fish and it has a summer streamflow of around 100 cfs. Compare that a famous western river like the Madison which has a flow over 1,000 cfs above Bozeman. Because of the sizes of my regular waters, I make very short casts, usually shorter than 20 feet, and often closer to ten feet. This is contrary to the idealized image of fly fishing, which is at least partially due to the dramatic fishing shots in A River Runs Through It.\n Casting in the movies.  Casting in real life.\nThe longer your line, the more likely it is you’re going to get something tangled, pile your line on your fly, or just be inaccurate with your cast. To me, there is a direct trade-off between casting accuracy and how much line you’re trying to cast. If you shorten your line, you’re much more likely to put the fly where you want it. And, that’s really the most important thing. I find that if I cast to a spot and make a bad cast, either by presenting the fly poorly, or putting it in the wrong area, I can probably try again and still bring the fish up. But if I do that more than two or three times, the fish will spook and I’ll have lost my chance. The thing that separates really good anglers from average anglers (I am decidedly in the average camp), is that they can make an accurate cast with good presentation to a spot the first time. It might take me two or three or four casts to get the same result, and with each successive catch, the greater the chance the fish will vanish. But even the best casters get less accurate with distance. A friend of mine related a story in which he was trying to make a complicated cast across the water when another friend said, “Are you trying to fish that hole over there? If so, just walk over there and cast into it.” That’s good advice.\n\n\nKeep Moving\nWhen I fished as a kid, and even when I started to learn to fly fish, I would stand in the same spot and cast repeatedly to the same area, sometimes for hours. Looking back, I can’t believe I did this. If a fish didn’t come up for the first fifty casts, why would it come up in the next fifty? As I’ve become better at spotting fish underwater, I also realize that trout will spook after a few casts over their hole. They’ll either move somewhere else, or go to the bottom of their hole and stay there. I’m now a believer in the idea that a hole gets five casts or so, maybe a few more if you’ve got good reason to believe there is a fish in the hole and you haven’t yet spooked it. After that, I move on.\nThe person who taught me to fly fish has an even stricter rule–he makes two or maybe three casts then moves on. I tend to give a spot a little bit more time than that, but not much more. Sometimes if I feel like I haven’t quite hit the spot I’m looking for, and haven’t totally blown the hole by splashing my fly or line all over it, I’ll keep casting into it. But, even five or six casts takes me no more than a minute. After that, I’ll cast to a different spot.\nBy moving, I mean that I wade the river, cast to likely spots a few times, then walk upriver to the next spot. On a river like the Logan, which is full of rocks and holes, I can move only one or two steps laterally or forward to the next spot. On other types of rives that have well-defined holes and riffles, there might be more walking between spots. Either way, I typically cover a lot of water. One of the reasons I get so annoyed with crowded rivers is that it prevents me from moving as much. If I walk upstream and run into another angler, I get out and walk way upriver to get clear of that angler as I don’t want to high-hole them.\n\n\nChange Flies, But Not Too Much\nI believe fly selection is largely overrated, and I think it’s an easy way to signal expertise and purposefully confuse new anglers. Yes, I understand that in some situations there might be a hatch that the fish are keying in on, and if you’re on a super famous river with a ton of pressure it might be really important to match the hatch. But, this is not the average experience. In mid-summer fly fishing on almost any western river, I feel like I basically need a caddis and a parachute adams, maybe in two or three different colors.\nIf your dry fly isn’t working at all, it might be time to switch flies. If this occurs, I always go smaller as I feel like fish will refuse to bite on flies that are too big, but not too small. It’s rare that you need a bigger fly if your existing fly isn’t working. I also switch colors sometimes, basically dividing flies into drab or bright. If drab isn’t working try bright, and vice versa. A lot of people make claims that say on low light days use drab flies (or maybe it’s other way around) but I’ve never noticed any patterns. A lot of this folk wisdom seems to work great except when it doesn’t. Don’t be inimated by fly selection, 90% of my fishing is done with no more than four or five flies. It isn’t a science, and we shouldn’t pretend like it is. Go with what feels right, if it doesn’t work, switch to something different.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "In early 2023, I went with my family to Tequila, Mexico for tequila tasting and sightseeing. I did a lot of research prior to going, mostly on Reddit and other individual blogs, and found they were of some help. I want to detail my experience so others can plan their trip. I can summarize my overall impression by saying, if you’re thinking about doing this, you should; it’s a great trip.\n\nTravel to Guadalajara\nWe flew from Tijuana, Mexico to Guadalajara. My family lives in Southern California and it’s much cheaper to cross into Mexico and fly one of the Mexican domestic carriers than it is to fly from the U.S. For most people, this won’t be possible, but most major U.S. airlines fly to Guadalajara. The Guadalajara airport is nice and fairly large, and it was an easy trip from the airport into the city by taxi for about $20. We bought the taxi ride from a stand inside the airport, as you should always do in Mexico, rather than hailing a taxi from the curb. A few sources online suggested that Uber was not available at the Guadalajara airport, but when I signed on, there were a number of cars available. We used the taxi because the stand was right in the baggage claim area and it just seemed easier.\nWe were concerned about safety before we left, especially because a few days before the Mexican Government arrested the son of El Chapo, and armed conflict broke out between the cartel and the government in Sinaloa, especially in the city of Culiacan. That city is more than 400 miles from Guadalajara, and we never felt unsafe whatsoever during the day. At night we were advised not to walk around our neighborhood, Colonia Americana, so we didn’t venture farther than about four blocks from the hotel in the evening. One night we had dinner at Alcalde, which was pricey but fantastic, and took an Uber there and back even though it was only about one mile each way, within walking distance for us.\nGuadalajara is an interesting and lively city, and it is worth staying a night or two there before heading to Tequila. We stayed three nights and that was probably one night too many. We had plans to see a rodeo, but all sporting events and some other public activities were canceled because of the violence. This was a one-off, unusual event, and not something that happens regularly. All the standard attractions in Guadalajara listed on other travel guides are worth visiting, so I won’t go into details about those here.\n\n\nFrom Guadalajara to Tequila\nAs far as I can tell, the vast majority of American tourists end up day-tripping from Guadalajara to Tequila. I think this is a mistake, as I really liked spending two nights in the town itself. The famous Jose Cuervo Tequila Train only runs on weekends, so we weren’t able to do that. From what I could gather, the train takes people into the town, lets them visit the Cuervo factory, walk around town, then takes them back to Guadalajara. I much preferred having some time to spend in the town itself.\nWe took an Uber from near the center of Guadalajara to Tequila. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes, and cost us $60. Getting back from Tequila to Guadalajara is trickier because there are not a lot of Ubers in Tequila. We ended up hiring a driver through our guide, which cost us $100. There are two other options: hire a taxi in Tequila to Guadalajara, if possible. There are taxis in town, but I’m not sure they’d be willing to drive all the way back or how much it would cost. The other option is the bus which goes from the Tequila bus station, close to the main tourist part of town, and stops at various stations in Guadalajara. The bus leaves every half hour or so all day, and costs only about $10 per person. This was our plan if we were unable to hire a car. The drawback of the bus is that it is slower than a car, and it ends at the central bus station from which you’d have to take an Uber or taxi to your hotel. Also be forewarned: there is often heavy traffic leaving and returning to Guadalajara.\n\n\nIn Tequila\n The town of Tequila, near the main square.\nThe town of Tequila is small and walkable, and felt completely safe. There seemed to be a lot of Mexican tourists drinking and taking tours in buses shaped like tequila barrels, but not many Americans. While there aren’t a ton of sights in the town per se, it’s just a nice place to walk around, hang out, and kill some time. There are distilleries/factories near the downtown area, and a ton of bars and shops; it’s kind of like a tamer version of walking the Vegas strip. If you want to go from shop to shop and bar to bar tasting tequila on the street, you’re in luck. Cantarito is the mixed drink of the moment, and seems to be quite popular among the locals and tourists. It’s made with tequila, citrus juice, and Squirt, and served in a clay cup. I prefer my tequila neat so tasting one cantarito was enough for me.\n “House” tequila in plastic jugs piling up in a bar.\nThere are a few tequila distilleries/factories in town, and we chose the Sauza tour for no other reason than it came recommended on Reddit. Orendain, Cuervo, and potentially others are possibilities. And again, each bar seems to have its own “house” tequila that you can taste. The Sauza tour was fine and we got free tequila drinks at the end. We made a reservation but some of them (maybe Orendain?) don’t require reservations. Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila.\n\n\nVisiting Distilleries Outside Town\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. Most of the guide services I saw only cost roughly $120 per person, though you can reduce individual costs with more people. I liked our guide a lot so please contact me for his information.\n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three.\n\n\nVisiting Logistics\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery.\n\n\nBringing Bottles Back\nThe rules about bringing liquor back into the U.S. are complicated, apparently, and we got stopped at the border after trying to declare our nine bottles. Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings.\n\n\nOutline of Our Trip\n\nThree nights in Guadalajara\n\nStayed at Rame Hotel Boutique\n\nTwo nights in Tequila\n\nStayed at AirBnb\n\nOne night in Tlaquepaque, a suburb of Guadalajara\n\nStayed at La Villa del Ensueno\n\nDistilleries visited\n\nCasa Sauza, in downtown Tequila\nCava del Oro, outside Tequila\nCascahuin, in Arenal outside Tequila\nTres Mujeres, outside Tequila\n\n\nAs I noted above, if one wanted to do this trip in fewer nights, one could do one or two nights in Guadalajara on the front end, two nights in Tequila, then straight back to the airport, or one night back in Guadalajara. I think two nights in Tequila is optimal because that gives you one day to arrive, walk around town and drink tequila, then another day to visit distilleries outside of town, leaving the next day. Everyone in my groups speaks decent Spanish, and we did one tour in Spanish (at Sauza), but it’s easy to find English-speaking guides. Almost everyone we encountered in the service industry in both Tequila and Guadalajara spoke some English.\nBack to Main Page"

As a result, this site is short on pictures but, I hope, long on details. I mostly skip the grip-and-grin fish pictures, and focus on the water and scenery.

Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila."

    "text": "Visiting Other Distilleries\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. \n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three."

    "text": "Visiting Logistics\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery."

Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings."

    "title": "Western Native Trout Challenge",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For whatever reason, I am not as excited for the Western Native Trout Challenge as I am for the state slams. I have been trying to put my finger on why, and I think it has something to do with the idea of becoming fully invested in a state and learning about the different drainages. The WNTC is bigger for sure, but it feels a little more instrumental; it’s kind of like, here’s a list of fish all over the country, go catch them. The best thing about the WNTC challenge is the high quality hat they send you.\nI will also admit that I find the rules incredibly confusing, and I’m wondering whether this sentiment is shared by others. What follows is a wonky discussion, but for those interested, I’ll explain why I think the WNTC rules are flawed. If you don’t care about this, you can skip to the next section.\nThe requirements for the first level, “Expert caster” are simple enough: catch six fish in four different states. After that, things get complicated. To complete the next step, “Advanced caster,” one must catch twelve fish in eight states, though the first six count from the Expert level count. To put it differently, you must repeat the Expert level with different fish species (you submit the fish that you caught for the first level, but you must catch six additional fish and cannot duplicate species for the second level).\nThe problem arises with the limited list of fish provided by each of the states. For example, suppose I wanted to fish in Washington. That state only has three qualifying fish: Redband, Westslope, and Coastal. Each of these fish are native to other states, and in fact I’ve already caught two of these fish for my first level, so I can only use one fish from Washington to advance to the next level of “Advanced caster”.\nNew Mexico only has two fish, one of which is also one of Colorado’s two fish, and the other Colorado fish is the Colorado River cutt, which is on the list for three other states. But, by catching the Colorado River cutt in Utah, I’ve now eliminated Colorado as a state unless I catch the Rio Grande, which in turn eliminates New Mexico as a state. You can catch the same species again and complete the lower “Expert” level for a second time, but it becomes very difficult to plan trips to reach each of the next two steps because one runs out of states pretty quickly. In statistics, we would say there are not enough degrees of freedom to complete each of the three levels without repeating fish (or without going to Alaska).\nI’m betting the challenge was setup this way after bargaining with each state’s Department of Fish and Game, and I imagine each state wants to direct people to certain places and certain fish. But this takes far too much advanced planning and thinking for my taste. What I wish they would have done is made each fish-state combination a possible catch, then just said, to complete the first level catch eight, second is catch 16, third is catch 22 (no pun intended). If one wants to catch a bull trout in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, go for it, that’s three of eight. Or, if an angler wants to catch five in Nevada and three in Utah, that’s enough for the “Expert level”, and reaching the next level requires another eight fish-state combinations. The eight fish requirement would have made the challenge “bigger” than any single state challenge and would have forced people to go to at least two states, and probably more. It also would have simplified things dramatically, and allowed anglers to fish wherever they wanted without having to backward induct where they might be or which fish they might catch in the future.\nTo make this a bit more concrete, I am planning to fish Oregon this summer (2023) and it would be nice to add some fish to complete the next level of the challenge. Here’s the problem. Oregon has five fish on the list, which is a lot, but none of these will help me reach the “Advanced caster” step. I need to catch a bull trout from Nevada for that state’s challenge, so catching one in Oregon doesn’t do anything for me. Same story for the Coastal Cutthroat, which I need for California’s challenge. The other three, Lahontan, Redband, and Westslope, I have already caught in other states and submitted to complete my first challenge level.\nAs a result, I don’t know when, or even if, I will be able to complete the second level of the challenge. It probably won’t be anytime soon, and I’m planning on directing most of my attention to state challenges.\n\nPreviously Caught Fish\nAs noted above, the WNTC requires six fish across four states. A few of the fish I could use from completing my Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada slams, though I needed to submit a slightly different combination of fish given the Challenge’s rules about different fish from different states.\nFrom previous slams, I submitted a Bonneville from the Logan River, Utah, and the Lahontan from Nevada. More details about my Utah and Nevada slams can be found here.\nThat is two fish from two states. The other two obvious states that I’ve fished quite a bit are Idaho and Wyoming. In Wyoming, the qualifying fish are the Bonneville, Colorado River, Westslope and Yellowstone. The Bonneville was out because I used that fish for Utah. The Westslope is also a a qualifying fish in Idaho, and the Yellowstone is a qualifying fish in Nevada and Wyoming. The only distinct fish between Idaho and Wyoming are the bull trout in Idaho, the Redband in Idaho, and the Colorado River in Wyoming. Basically, I’d need some combination of those fish between those two states.\nBecause I’d already caught Colorado River and Yellowstone cutthroats in Wyoming for the Wyoming slam, I now I had four fish from three states. Perhaps surprisingly, I had not caught any qualifying fish in Idaho. Catching any qualifying fish there (that I wasn’t submitting for another state) would give me five fish and four states, and then I could submit any other fish from any state.\n\n\nAborted Attempt to Fish Near Lincoln, MT\nFish number five I caught in the summer of 2019 during a family trip to Lake Coeur d’Alene. I left a few days early and drove through the eastern part of Idaho into Montana, with plans to fish the Lincoln and Ovando, MT areas. From there, I would pick up the 90, and drive to the Idaho panhandle, fishing some rivers there. This did not work as expected, and in fact, the trip went very poorly, right up to the point where it went great.\nI was not in charge of scheduling the stay on Lake Coeur d’Alene and I was worried about my fishing plan because it was still very early in the season, around June 15th. I suspected the larger rivers like the Blackfoot and Clark Fork would still be blown out, and when I got to the area it was clear they were unfishable. Instead, my planned first stop was a forest service campground on a small creek called Copper Creek. The scenery and campground were nice enough but on arrival, I saw that the drainage had semi-recently burned. As a result, there were downed trees all over the creek. It was almost impossible to wade for any period of time, and while I’m sure a more determined angler could have made it work, I gave up pretty quickly. The creek was high, the downfall was bad, and I’d driven all day and it was getting dark.\n Copper Creek, Montana. The deadfall and high water made it almost impossible to fish.\n Looking down on the Copper Creek drainage and toward the Scapegoat Wilderness.\nI spent the night in the campground and had plans the next morning to hike to the Landers Fork, which was about two miles from the trailhead near the campground. Two things happened that prevented this. The first is that I very quickly developed a weird cramp in my foot that made hiking difficult. As I was debating whether or not to turn around and hike back to my car, the second thing happened: I saw a relatively fresh, massive grizzly print on the trail. If ever the universe was giving me a sign, this was it. I turned around, got in my car, and left Copper Creek to continue my drive to Idaho.\n Time to turn around! While the mud around the track was dry, the tracks themselves appeared relatively fresh–maybe a week old, at most.\nI have never seen a grizzly up close in the lower 48. I saw a young black bear from about one hundred yards hiking in the Salt River Range in Wyoming, and I saw a black spot, from maybe a mile away, beelining over a pass (and toward me) in the Gros Ventre Range above Granite Hot Springs, WY. I’m not sure it was a grizzly bear, and I’m not even sure it was a bear at all, but it was big and fast, and didn’t move like an ungulate. Incidentally two years later, in 2021, a grizzly attacked and killed a camper in the town of Ovando, MT.\n The Lincoln Ranger office in Lincoln, MT has a very large grizzly bear on display.\n\n\nCoeur d’Alene River–Westslope Cutthroat\nFrom Montana, I drove straight through to the North Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River, but arrived too late in the day to do much fishing. I stopped at Honeysuckle Campground and was the only person staying there. Things were looking up, until I saw that the fee for the campground was $24 a night! How could it be so expensive when no one was there? And come on, that is outrageous for a national forest service campground. I don’t think I’ve ever paid more than about $16 for one of these campgrounds and I refused to pay it on principle. I resolved the next day to leave the campground and find dispersed camping in the area. I had plans to drive over a ridge and down into the Teepee Creek watershed which eventually flows into the mainstem Coeur d’Alene. I’d read online that fishing was good in Teepee and I’ve always enjoyed fishing smaller waters (online sources refer to it as both “Tepee” and “Teepee”).\nThe fishing was decent on Teepee Creek. I packed up camp, made the short drive over to the creek, and began fishing a meadow near a research station of some kind. The water was a little high, and I didn’t have any success on dry flies, so I switched to a dry dropper setup. I lost one nice fish, then hooked another. Regrettably, I took almost no pictures on this trip for some reason, so in lieu of a Teepee Creek picture, here is one of the fish I caught, a 15 inch Westslope cutthroat.\n My first Westslope cutt from Teepee Creek.\nThings began to warm up and I couldn’t get any more action on Teepee Creek so I made the decision to drive farther down the forest road, which would take me back to the mainstem Couer d’Alene, then back out to the junction where the North Fork and Coeur d’Alene meet, just outside of Caltado, Idaho. The drive up the North Fork to Honeysuckle, then over to Teepee, and back down the mainstem makes a big loop. I needed to get back to civilization anyway to make a phone call, and I still had to find a dispersed camping site. Despite being early in the season, both rivers were at summer flows and I made a few stops to fish along the Coeur d’Alene, but I didn’t have any success.\nIt was crowded, as most holes had a guy or two in them, and there were a lot of people driving the road looking for spots. This suggested to me that the river sees a lot of pressure. It’s big enough, but the water miles alongside the road are somewhat limited so I think the fish in the obvious holes see a lot of flies. There are also lots of other people recreating, swimming in the river, wading, etc., which isn’t necessarily the best for fishing. Despite it being mid-June, it was very hot. In fact, the temperature reached 105, or close to it, in the town of Coeur d’Alene which, needless to say, is not good for the fishing. After a few frustrating hours, a lot of which was spent just trying to find some space on the river, I gave up.\nI started back up the road to Honeysuckle Campground, off the mainstem and onto the North Fork to find a spot to disperse camp. There was a tiny turnoff in the road which didn’t look like much but beneath it, in the trees, was an obvious camping area. I found my free spot at last (take that, Recreation.gov). After setting up camp, I walked down to the river in the evening and fished a little. I didn’t have much success until I came to a small, obvious-looking pool that definitely held fish. I caught a few, tiny trout, though a moose did appear out of the timber on the other side of the river from me. Despite the lack of fishing excitement, that was one of those transcendent experiences that make it all worth while; just me and a moose hanging out by the river in the twilight. Shortly after the moose left, I heard a noise from behind me and expected another moose (or a bear), but it was two other fisherman. I’m not even sure where they came from as the road was up the hill and there weren’t any other campsites around. Was there nowhere on this river where I would have some space to myself? I gave up the hole to them as I wasn’t having much success and went back to my camp.\nThe next morning I was supposed to meet the family in Harrison, on the lake. I was frustrated after the previous day and my plan was to just pack up and leave. I packed up, but made the last minute decision to fish in the morning, and try once again to catch a decent fish in the North Fork Coeur d’Alene. I walked down to the river above a bridge and began wading upstream. I’d tried a lot of different combinations of flies and setups in the previous two days, but because I wasn’t expecting much and was feeling lazy, I had a size 12 or 14 caddis on my line, about the simplest setup imaginable. I pretty quickly caught some small cutts in a shallow section of the river, which encouraged me to wade farther upstream. In a nice looking hole, I made a cast, and a massive fish took the fly. It was more than 15 inches and fought hard. Eventually I landed the fish in my net, and saw that it had another fly with broken line in its mouth. I removed my fly, got the other fly out, and released the fish. I’d actually caught a large Westslope Cutthroat in the North Fork. It was all gravy from there, and I waded upstream and caught more large fish. That turned out to be one of my best days of fishing ever.\nIs the Coeur d’Alene a good trout river? I think so? I didn’t have any success for about the first ten hours I fished (yes, I hooked two cutts in Teepee Creek), but the last four or so were magical. I’m not sure what changed, other than my fly. It is crowded, and I don’t like crowds, but clearly if you can find the right spots with the right fly, there are some fish worth catching. And, after all that, the Idaho Westslope gave me five fish from four states.\n\n\nBig Wood River–Redband Trout\nI had no idea that redband trout are a form of rainbow trout, until I read it on the Idaho Fish and Game websie. A lot of people, it seems, are confused by this based on what I’ve read in other fly fishing forums. Here’s what the IFG says, “All rainbow trout native to streams east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington are called redband trout.” This would be my last fish necessary for to complete the first level of the WNTC, and I had a plan to fish for it on the Big Wood River in Ketchum, Idaho.\nI’m in the Ketchum/Sun Valley area often enough, and it’s one of my favorite mountain towns. There are a lot of outdoor activites, it’s beautiful, especially in the fall, and the Big Wood flows right through town. There is only one problem: I’ve never actually had much success on the Big Wood. A few times I’ve been to Ketchum, my timing has been bad. One year it was still too high to fish and my attempt to wade it nearly resulted in me getting swept downstream into the Snake. Most other times I’ve been to Ketchum I’ve been with other people who don’t want to fish and have only limited patience for watching me fish. I finally got my chance to really fish it in the summer of 2020 when we took advantage of remote work to spend a week at an Airbnb in Hailey. There would be no dining out or hitting the town, but I would have a chance to spend some time on the Big Wood.\nThe unfortunate part of the Big Wood is that it is crowded. That’s to be expected given that it flows through a series of famous mountain towns, and there are fly shops in Ketchum that provide guide services. But still, the first day I tried to fish it in 2020, I didn’t have to wade that far upriver until I ran into another group coming down. I turned around to go back, and there was yet another group behind me. I’ve had more success driving upstream or downstream of town rather than trying to fish in Ketchum itself.\nIn fact, the first redband trout I caught was in Hailey, near where I was staying. It was mid-July, and the water was still a little high, but wadeable. It was clear nothing was happening on the surface, so I used both a dry dropper and a tight-line nymph setup to catch fish. Both worked relatively well. Later in the trip I went upstream and managed to catch one or two fish on a dry, though I was using a dropper as well, and that seemed to work better.\nThat experience on the Big Wood was very serviceable. The fishing was steady though not spectacular, I didn’t catch any fish over about 12 inches, nor did I have much action on drys. Still, the Big Wood is a pretty easy river to figure out. Staying in Ketchum or Hailey and spending a few days fishing the Big Wood, and some nearby creeks (e.g., Trail Creek), is a pleasant experience. Just don’t expect to be alone on the water.\n\n\nOther Fish\nWith the Redband from the Big Wood, I had my six fish from four states. Even though I’d previously caught a Yellowstone and Colorado River cutt for the Wyoming slam, I actually submitted two different fish from my slam fish, just for fun. I caught a Colorado River cutthroat from the very top of LaBarge Creek in the Tri-Basin divide. The creek here is very small, but I managed to bring up a few fish. Most people are going to want to fish it farther downstream where the creek is larger, however.\nI also submitted a Yellowstone from South Leigh Creek, outside of Driggs, Idaho. There are a number of small creeks flowing off the western side of the Teton Range, and I picked South Leigh because it was closest to where I was staying. I believe Bitch Creek to be the most famous fishing water of these creeks, and I have backpacked, but not fished, in that drainage. I believe Teton Creek, Badger Creek, North Leigh Creek, and others are also possibilities, but I haven’t fished any of these either. My impression is they are all pretty small and might make for a nice small-water experience, but aren’t going to provide great fishing. Keep in mind that while you’re on the west side of the Tetons and the towns themselves are located in Idaho, almost all the public lands where you can fish are in Wyoming.\n Grand Tetons from Driggs, Idaho area.\n\n\nSubmitted Fish\nHere are the fish I submitted for the “Expert” level of the WNTC and where I caught them.\n\nBonneville Cutt\n\nLogan River, UT\n\nColorado River Cutt\n\nLaBarge Creek, WY\n\nWestslope Cutt\n\nTeepee Creek, ID\n\nYellowstone Cutt\n\nS.

    "title": "Attending Oktoberfest, Munich Germany",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I went to Munich for Oktoberfest in 2022, the first year the event was hold since the pandemic. A number of my friends had been and encouraged me to go, with one of them saying something like, “it’s the most fun I’ve ever had.” My overall verdict is not quite as enthusiastic. I thought it was mostly fun, though it wasn’t the life-changing experience I was hoping it would be.\nA number of things worked against me. First, I got sick three days into a five day trip. I don’t think it was COVID as I took a few tests which were all negative, but one of my friends tested positive when he arrived back in the states. I will say that if you are at all concerned about getting COVID, Oktoberfest is not the place for you. The tents are fully enclosed with tens of thousands of people drinking, singing, and yelling, and the bathrooms are crowded and not well ventilated. I was told after leaving that the “Wiesen-flu” is a common sickness around Germany after Oktoberfest ends. I’m guessing that’s what I got, and though I felt better enough to leave my AirBnB after about a day and a half of sickness, it took me weeks to shake the congestion.\nBesides being stuck in a hotel room for about a day and half during my trip, it was rainy and cold the entire time. This means the outdoor beer gardens at both the tents and within the city were all closed. This also probably made things more crowded inside and at times, it was difficult to find room in the tents (more on that below). Finally, our AirBnB was not nice, which is a thing that happens sometimes and there isn’t much to do about it. Rates in hotels and AirBnBs for Oktoberfest are pricey, and we tried to squeeze five or six people into three bedrooms, with limited success.\n\nTravel to and Around Munich\nIt’s easy enough to fly from the states to Munich, and once one arrives, there is a train that goes straight into the city after about a half hour ride. I suppose one could take an Uber or taxi, but there’s almost no reason to do that as the train is cheap and straightforward. Make sure you buy a ticket though because the police checked on the train I was on and wrote two women a ticket.\nOnce in Munich, there is a bus and streetcar system that is kind of navigable to non-German speakers. It took us a few attempts to figure out how to buy tickets as there weren’t any machines at most of the streetcar stations, but you can buy them from the drivers. This requires having the right Euro denominations, however.\nI mostly used the city bike and scooter shares, and walked. Annoyingly, the bike share requires an app that is easiest to setup before you leave and can be found here. Another word of caution. My friend and I tried to use scooters after leaving Oktoberfest one night when the police approached us and warned us that we weren’t allowed to bike or scooter after drinking. They were exceedingly nice about it, but told us that doing so is the equivalent of driving a car drunk (which is, of course, complete absurd). Another night I rode a bike home and no one stopped me, but apparently that was risky.\n\n\nOktoberfest Grounds\nWithin the Oktoberfest grounds, there are rides, food, tents, and gift shops. The food, both at the stands and in the tents, was shockingly good. The tents are mostly chicken and sausage, priced at roughly what they would be in the states. Outside at the stands, there was a greater variety and was perhaps a bit cheaper than in the tents. The rides are carnival rides basically, and I wasn’t interested because of how cold and rainy it was.\nThe tents and grounds are more crowded at night, obviously, but surprisingly, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. We saw only one fight our entire Oktoberfest trip, not involving Americans, thank god.\n\n\nThe Tents\nThere are something like twelve different main tents, and I probably walked through about eight of them. The vibe inside each of them was shockingly different–one tent seemed to have more Germans, while another tent seemed to have no one over the age of about 20 in it. They all have different looks and decorations, though all of them have a band and band leaders and they all seemed to basically play the same songs. It was a mix of pop singalong favorites (think Abba, YMCA, Take Me Home Country Roads, Sweet Caroline) and German songs, especially the “Ziggy Zaggy, Ziggy Zaggy, Oi Oi” song. For some reason, “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus, which I hadn’t heard in 15 years, is really popular. The music, especially the pop music, gets kind of old after awhile as it seems pitched at the Boomer/Gen-X karoake demographic. The beer mostly tastes the same though I had a weak preference for some of the beers over others.\nHow wild were things inside the tents? It kind of depended on the tent, but moderately wild, especially at night. After about 7 p.m. everyone has had a lot to drink so most people are just drinking and talking. As alluded to above, everyone is pretty well behaved and security is present but not exactly like at an American club. I saw one person throwing up everywhere and security eventually saw him and gently escorted him out. I saw a handful of people doing drugs and they weren’t exactly being that surreptitious about it. I didn’t see any fights except the one I mentioned outside a tent. In some of the tents, people stand on the benches rather than sit at the table, but occassionally a bench goes over and people go everywhere.\n\n\nDo You Need Reservations?\nYes, it would be helpful, but reservations are not strictly necessary and it isn’t that easy for non-Germans to make reservations. It seems to depend on the tent, the day, and the time. Our experience was that reservations were not needed anywhere during the day as things were pretty open, especially on Thursday and Friday. At night, things were more crowded, and reservations were required in some of the tents we visited. In others, the servers were willing to squeeze you in if there was room at a table, though in most of the tents you could also squeeze into the walkways, though this is a bit claustrophobic and uncomfortable.\nOur experience was as follows. The first tent we went to was on Thursday afternoon and it wasn’t very crowded. We were able to sit down and we ordered food and beers. At about 4 p.m., the server kicked us out of our table so they could begin preparing for the evening shift, for which all tables were reserved.\nAfter that, we walked into another tent, couldn’t find any space, walked into a third tent, and decided we needed to be more aggressive about making space. My group split up, and myself and two of my friends were able to make space in a walkway rather than at a table. This made it a little tricky to get beer, though with a little persistence we were able to. I think the key thing for Americans to remember is that personal space and beer service are not as regimented as in the U.S. If you see a plausible place to stand, occupy that space until someone makes you move. If you see a server walking by with beer, wave them down. It’s a little bit more of a free-for-all as compared to American restaurants or bars.\nThe next night, Friday night, was much more crowded, but we were able to get a table in a tent in the early afternoon. This particular tent did not make us leave and we held that table until closing (which is early, about 10 p.m.) The server did try to squeeze other people in at our table, and if your party wasn’t large enough, other people were going to be put at your table.\nThe reality is, even if you want to make a reservation it’s likely not going to be possible. Figuring out the websites prior to leaving the States seemed almost impossible. Those sites that I could figure out required significant deposits for both beer and food (something like $150 a person, with a minimum on the number of people) that I wasn’t willing to shell out before getting to Germany.\nIn sum, though I think reservations would have helped, especially the first night, it wasn’t easy to make them and we were able to survive without them. It’s important to get to a tent before things get crowded in the early evening. If you get kicked out of your table at 4 p.m., move quickly to another tent to get a table for the evening. If you’ve got a table at around 5, don’t leave it unless you’re ready to go home.\n\n\nWould I Go Back?\nI’ve thought about this question a lot, and I think the answer is yes, especially if I knew other people who were going. In retrospect, I had a lot of bad luck that diminished my fun. Getting sick halfway through the trip meant I didn’t actually get all that much time at Oktoberfest. The weather definitely didn’t help things either.\nIf you can’t go during Oktoberfest, one could have a similar experience just by going to the beer halls in downtown Munich. In fact, we did that the first night and it may have been my favorite overall experience. Many of the breweries have their own halls near Marienplatz and it’s easy to walk between them. The beer is the same, the food is probably better, and there are Oktoberfest bands and lots of other people hanging out.\nOne final thing: wear lederhosen or a dirndl at Oktoberfest. Almost everyone wears it, and it makes the experience more fun and festive. I read some stuff online that said not to buy cheap or knock-off clothes because the Germans will be annoyed, but I really doubt anyone would notice. I bought some lederhosen but my friends rented from this place, which was a good option.\nHey baby won’t you be my girl reference"
