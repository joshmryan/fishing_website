    "title": "Utah Cutthroat Slam: A Guide to Catching Utah’s Native Trout",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In Cache Valley, there are a number of options for catching the Bear River cutthroat as all local waters contain them. The Logan River is the largest river, and most obvious option. It’s a classic western free-stone trout stream, fishable from about early July through early November. In most places, the Logan is no more than knee deep, though there are some larger holes.\nBrown trout, and even some brook and rainbow trout also exist in the Logan, but the higher one goes in the canyon, the more likely it is one will catch a cutt. I mentally divide the river into lower, middle, and upper sections. I think of the lower section as from the mouth of the canyon where a small lake exists (locally referred to as “first dam”), to about Card Canyon, where there is a picnic area and turnout on the highway. From there, the middle section flows close to the road in most places in a tight canyon until the road climbs high above the river, referred to as the “dugway.” I’d never heard that term until I moved to Utah, and I’m still not sure what it means, but the road cuts across the face of a mountain and climbs until it once again meets the river. Temple Fork flows into the Logan shortly after the dugway. The upper part of the Logan is my favorite area to fish as the river is usually a little farther away from the road, and the fishing and scenery are good. However, this area probably receives the most pressure, though pressure on the Logan is light compared to most well-known western trout streams.\nI almost always fish above about Card Canyon (haven’t had much success lower), and the middle canyon section is mostly brown trout. My experience has been that after the dugway, in the upper section, there are more cutts than browns. The fishing is generally good on drys, especially in mid to late summer. Current regulations prohibit fishing from Red Banks Campground upstream to Idaho until the second weekend in July, though in a good water year the river will be still be blown out by then.\nNear the top of the canyon, the Logan River leaves the highway and flows almost due north-south from its headwaters in Idaho. This area is referred to as Franklin Basin, and there is a good forest road that parallels the river in this area with lots of dispersed camping, though it can get crowded. Beaver Creek flows into the Logan from the northeast at the start of Franklin Basin (moving upstream) and the highway flows alongside of it after leaving the mainstem Logan.\n Franklin Basin in the fall.\nThe Logan in Franklin Basin, Beaver Creek, and the Temple Fork are almost excluisvely cutts and have good fishing. I’ve had a lot of success in Franklin Basin, and in Spawn Creek, which meets Temple Fork a mile upstream of Temple Fork’s confluence with the Logan. A short hike up Spawn Creek offers nice beaver ponds, but I sometimes find the fish here can be surprisingly picky. I’ve never seen anyone else fishing Spawn Creek. I’ve had less success in Temple Fork, though I have caught fish in it. A lot of it is pretty brushy, and the more open parts don’t seem to hold a lot of fish, so I generally prefer Spawn Creek. Franklin Basin is also brushy in parts, especially farther upstream, but there are a lot of fish in there.\n Beaver ponds on Spawn Creek.\nLower down, Right Hand Fork flows into the Logan from the right hand side of the highway (moving upstream), and is all cutthroats. There is a good forest service road up some of Right Hand Fork, and a campground near the junction of two forest roads. There is also a trail that continues up Right Hand Fork after the road ends, following the creek for about 1.5 to 2 miles. Right Hand Fork seems to be a popular place to catch cutts. There are a few promotional videos online of media personalities and DWR employees talking about the slam and where to catch Bear River cutts, and it often looks like they are in Right Hand Fork.\nThe creek is separated from the mainstem Logan by a weir built a few years ago to protect it from encroaching browns. Right Hand Fork was then treated in 2013 to kill the browns and replanted with cutts sometime after. When I started fishing it in 2016, it was full of cutts and once I figured out how to deal with the brush, there were days when I caught dozens of fish. Since then, the fish seem to have become a little bit smarter so the fishing does not seem quite as good as it did in 2016 or 2017, although fish densities are very high. The one challenge with Right Hand Fork is that is a very small and brushy stream for much of its course near the road and trail, so it can be difficult to find a spot to cast. Rattlesnakes and moose are hazards.\n Right Hand Fork in the fall.\nHaving said all that about the Logan and its tributaries, I caught my Bear River in Curtis Creek, which flows through Hardware Ranch WMA into the Blacksmith Fork. The Blacksmith Fork is the second largest river in the valley, and the fishing is great in mid-summer. Because it’s smaller, it also clears from runoff a lot earlier than the Logan, making it fishable by mid-June in an average/good water year. Unfortunately, about 90% of the fish in Blacksmith Fork are browns. In fact, the DWR has a bonus limit of four additional brown trout, meaning you can catch and keep eight brown trout per day (as of 2023).\nThe ratio of cutts to browns in Curtis Creek is better than the mainstem Blacksmith Fork, probably something like 4 to 1 rather than 9 to 1. For my cutt slam, I caught the fish in mid-April as Curtis Creek drains a small area and is probably the first creek in the area to clear from runoff. Rock Creek, which flows into Blacksmith Fork a little lower, also has some cutts and clears relatively early as well. If one drives on the forest road through Hardware Ranch, the road eventually meets Rock Creek again higher up. It’s easy to park near the bridge and fish up the meadow, or move downstream and fish through some smaller meadows and into a small canyon. I’ve done this a few times and caught a lot of fish (mostly browns). The only drawback is that it’s about an hour drive from Logan each way so I don’t fish it that often, though neither does anyone else. In the spring and summer, there is a lot of dispersed camping in the area and people like to use the forest road through Hardware Ranch to see how fast they can drive their side-by-sides.\n A local enjoying the Blacksmith Fork river.\nThe other option for a Bear River cutt is Left Hand Fork of the Blacksmith, which flows past a number of campgrounds on Left Hand Fork road. This is one of my favorite places to fish early in the season (before Memorial Day) because it clears early and there are a lot of fish, but it’s almost all browns, in my experience. Unfortunately the quantity of dispersed camping and campgrounds means it is overrun by Memorial Day, and the area is an absolute nightmare during the height of summer. I’ve nearly experienced dog attacks and ATV crashes on Left Hand Fork Road. People seem to enjoy dropping their trailer or tent in a spot and reserving it for the entire summer. The forest service has made some efforts to better organize the dispersed camping and enforce the 14 day stay limit, though as far as I can tell, these efforts do not yet seem to be effective.\n Left Hand Fork of Blacksmith Fork.\nIf I were trying to catch the Bear River cutt, I’d probably start in the upper Logan or Franklin Basin, and failing that, go to Right Hand Fork. The fishing in the Logan and Franklin Basin is easier because they are bigger waters and there is more room to cast and wade. But, if those two didn’t work for whatever reason, Right Hand Fork is almost a sure thing if you can find a spot to make a cast without spooking the fish or getting tangled in the brush. Spawn Creek is also a good option, but it requires a 15 to 20 minute hike up to the beaver ponds, and there are brooks and browns in addition to cutthroats."

Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows that the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike the Utah Slam, which I did over the course of a summer, I attempted the Wyoming Slam over the course of a few days. It didn’t work, and I had to make a second trip to Wyoming to complete the slam, but because I don’t live in Wyoming, I initially wanted to minimize driving back-and-forth. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about this approach. I definitely felt rushed the whole trip, feeling like I was doing more driving than fishing. On the other hand, I knocked out three of the four fish I needed in about five days, including the fish farthest from my house that I wanted to avoid having to make a second round trip to catch. When I had a free weekend near the end of summer, I drove back to Wyoming to target one fish, and luckily it was one of the closest to my house. I wouldn’t want to complete a challenge over this short of a timespan again, but for most of us who don’t live in western Wyoming and have jobs and other responsibilities, trying to complete the slam in a week or so is the most viable option.\nDespite the long driving distances, I thought Wyoming would be easier than the Utah slam; the state has more options for each fish, bigger water (less brush), and at the time, had more resources online to help plan a fishing trip. Wyoming has a program called “Instream Flow” that provides helpful information on lots of different rivers and creeks, and a separate challenge called “XStream Angler” in which you receive a hat if you a take a picture of yourself near three qualifying rivers or creeks. This is an easy thing to complete when you do your slam as most waters fished in the slam are also considered “instream flow” rivers. When I did the slam a few years ago, they required pictures near seven rivers, but perhaps that was too demanding for most people.\nMy driving plan was somewhat convoluted, and in retrospect, I did not do this correctly. Once I’d caught the Bonneville, I planned to go up a road that follows the Smiths Fork north, take that up and over to the Tri-Basin divide, fish for the Colorado River Cutthroat in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to fish for Snake River cutthroat. This proved to be unsuccessful because the road up Smiths Fork connecting with the Tri-Basin divide slowly deteriorated as we drove up it. Eventually, we came to a spot where the road turned into a giant mud puddle and though it looked like I might be able to get my truck through it, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and turned around. I once got stuck in mud on a dirt road in Kansas, and that experience scarred me so deeply I have become extremely risk averse on muddy roads. Unfortunately, this meant going all the way back out to Cokeville and driving around the southern end of the Wyoming Range. It also changed the creeks I would fish, which ended up having significant consequences.\n\n\nBonneville Cutts are found in rivers that flow into the Great Basin. Utah further separates species into Bear River and Bonneville, while Wyoming makes no such distinct. I don’t know what the scientific case is for calling the Bear River and Bonneville separate species, and I suspect Utah does it because they can’t have a fish slam with only three species. Regardless, Hobble Creek flows into the Bear River via the Smiths Fork from the Wyoming Range outside of Cokeville, Wyoming. It’s only about an hour and a half from my home in Cache Valley, Utah so this was the first place I started. I’ve now done quite a bit of hiking, camping, and fishing in the Wyoming Range and adjacent Salt River Range, both of which are incredibly underrated.\nMy first stop, Hobble Creek is reached by a long drive on relatively good forest roads up until the last mile or so where there is a creek crossing. High clearance vehicles without four-wheel drive should have no problem in mid-Summer, but I wouldn’t take a sedan across the creek. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a spot for dispersed camping at the crossing that I could see, so it’s important to cross and get to the campground farther down the road. At the campground is also a day-use parking lot for Lake Alice, which is about a two mile hike. It makes for a nice sidetrip and the lake has an interesting geological history. This area is used quite a bit by locals visiting the lake on daytrips, but there was only one other site taken in the campground. I think the creek receives a moderate amount of pressure farther downstream as I’ve seen a few people fishing it the times I’ve been up there.\n Into a big brown on Hobble Creek.\nAlice Creek, which flows out of Lake Alice, comes into Hobble right at the campground, and the flow is greater after their confluence. When you first enter Hobble Creek canyon on the forest road, before the campground, Coantag Creek joins up with Hobble Creek and also significantly increases the flow into Hobble. I think most people fish from this point downstream because it’s a bigger creek so they assume it holds bigger fish, and it’s the closest road access for people who drive up for the day.\nI’ve only fished upstream from Coantag Creek, on Hobble Creek up to Alice Creek, then above Alice Creek. Besides the increased pressure, the problem with fishing downstream of Coantag Creek is that it if you stay at the campground, you either need to walk or drive downstream approximately a mile or two to get back to this water. That didn’t make much sense to me so I just walked down the road a few hundred yards to get downstream of the campground then fished back up to it. I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I can promise there are very large fish, both cutts and browns, upstream of Coantag Creek near the campground.\nWhen I was fishing for the slam, it was my first time fishing Hobble. On the Logan, my “home river,” there is a fish in every soft spot on the river, almost behind every rock. Because that was what I was used to, and I didn’t have a lot of experience fishing other rivers, I expected to have higher catch rates in Hobble Creek. In fact, when we arrived at the campground in the late afternoon, I walked upstream of the campground and found a nice hole with an undercut bank. Almost immediately, I hooked into a large fish that ended up being a brown. I wasn’t expecting brown trout in Hobble Creek as I thought it was all cutthroat, so though it was a 15 inch plus fish, it didn’t count for the slam. That first fish fooled me because I thought the fishing was going to be easy but I had a more difficult time catching a cutthroat the next morning.\nI wasted a lot of time fishing spots that in retrospect weren’t likely to hold fish. Eventually, I caught exactly one cutthroat and a few additional browns, and had my first fish of the Wyoming slam. Hobble Creek has since become one of my favorite fishing and camping spots, and I’ve subsequently caught very large (nearly 20 inch) cutthroats in the creek, though there are perhaps not as many fish as I would expect given how good the water looks.\nOn that first trip, the large brown I caught made for a delicious dinner. I usually practice catch and release, and I would never keep a cutthroat in a native drainage, but I view browns in these drainages as an invasive species so I sometimes eat them.\n Catch and cook.\n\n\n\nAs I described above, an attempt to take the road which parallels the Smiths Fork over to Tri-Basin Divide didn’t work as the road was impassable. I was worried this was going to happen and it added hours of driving. Smiths Fork above Cokeville, near the turnoff to the road to Hobble Creek, is a large-ish river that is supposed to have very good fishing. However, access is a bit of a problem as most of the river is private, and there is nowhere to camp nearby. This could be an option for the Bonneville if one wanted to stay in a hotel near Cokeville, though I believe the Smiths Fork also has browns in it. I chose Hobble Creek because it offered convenient camping. I later fished the Smiths Fork up much higher, closer to the Tri-Basin divide, which has much better forest road access (the road I was attempting to connect to) and flows through public land. There is abundant and excellent dispersed camping in this area, but surprisingly, the fishing wasn’t very good for me over two nights of camping. I caught a few fish here and there but in general I really struggled. I’ve only fished it that once so I’m not sure if that was bad technique on my part or if the fishing really isn’t that great.\nThe vast majority of people attempting the slam center their efforts on Tri-Basin divide. One can catch the Bonneville in upper Smiths Fork, drive a very short way to catch the Colorado River in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to catch the Snake River. All three of these fish exist within maybe a five mile radius. Because I couldn’t connect up to Tri-Basin, I drove around the southern end of the Wyoming Range to fish the creeks coming off the east side of the range, then connected over to the Greys on forest roads via McDougal Gap. Again, literally every Wyoming Cutt Slam report online says to fish LaBarge Creek, but I didn’t want to drive up LaBarge Creek road, then down Greys River road as I thought that would add significant time, and there aren’t any campgrounds on LaBarge Creek or in the Tri-Basin area. Because the Wyoming Fish and Game lists a number of creeks on the east side of the Wyoming Range that hold cutts, I thought I would just fish these. The night after leaving Hobble, we camped at Sacajawea Campground which is located on Middle Piney Creek.\n Middle Piney creek near Sacajawea Campground. Small, but should have given more effort. The smoke started moving in.\nSacajawea is another amazing, nearly deserted forest service campground in Wyoming that should be crowded. Unfortunately, Middle Piney Creek was tiny and my brief efforts to fish on evening arrival didn’t yield anything. Here is where feeling time pressured got to me. Instead of giving Middle Piney a real chance, the next day we decided to begin heading to Greys River Road and fish along the way as the drive over to the Greys would cross a number of creeks. Before I complain about the fishing, I will say the scenery on this drive is spectacular.\nThe first stop was North Piney Creek. The fishing was slow but I did manage to catch a brook trout, which was not helpful. The second stop was North Cottonwood Creek, which parallels the forest road which goes over McDougal Gap. After about an hour of fishing unsuccessfully, I finally caught a small brook trout. This was very frustrating, and out of ideas, I gave up and we drove over McDougal Gap to the Greys River.\n North Piney Creek. Looks good, caught nothing but a few brooks.\n Same story on North Cottonwood.\n Driving between basins on east side of Wyoming Range.\n\n\n\nThe Greys River forms in the Tri-Basin divide and Greys River Road runs its entire length, from there to Alpine, WY where the Greys meets the Snake in Palisades Resevoir. The road is well maintained and well traveled, and while this area isn’t exactly deserted, its not so crowded as to be unpleasant. The scenery is spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be very good as well. We stayed in Forest Park Campground which is just upriver from where the forest road over McDougal Gap meets Greys River Road. Forest Park was also mostly empty, though a lot of people prefer to disperse camp along the Greys River.\n Over McDougal Gap into Greys River drainage, forest road at bottom left. It had been smoky all day.\nI eventually caught my Snake River cutt in the Greys. It was not spectacular fishing in terms of catch rate or size, but the surroundings made up for much of that. It was very hot when I was there, and nothing really started happening until late in the afternoon. I’d already been fishing for a few hours so I caught maybe three or four medium size cutts and called it. We had a very long drive planned the next day, and I was frustrated after my lack of success fishing for the Colorado River cutt.\nOddly, I’ve never fished the Greys again, despite passing by it a number of times. There isn’t a good reason for that, other than I’ve never really gotten around to it. I would like to drive its entire length from Alpine to Tri-Basin divide. Years later, for my Western Native Trout Challenge, I fished the very top of LaBarge Creek and caught a Colorado River cutt, but didn’t make it down to the Greys. I’d like to determine whether my slow evenings on both the Smiths Fork and Greys River were aberrations or if the fishing is not as good as reports suggest. One other note on Greys River road: when leaving Greys River Road and entering Alpine, WY, a stop at Melvin Brewery is mandatory.\n\n\n\nWas the drive from Alpine, though Jackson, Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, out to Cody, and to the Greybull River a frustrating slog through bumper-to-bumper traffic? Yes, and I won’t relive it by elaborating further. I’ve now driven through Yellowstone twice in the summer, and I’m sorry to say it’s just awful.\nOutside of Cody, and closer to Meeteetse, WY, there are quite a few possibilities for the Yellowstone cutthroat. Both the Greybull and Wood River are supposed to have fantastic fishing, and I chose the Greybull because of the forest service campground on the river and because Jack Creek flows into the Greybull at the campground; if the mainstem didn’t work, I would have a backup.\n Sunset over Jack Creek Campground.\nThe road from Meeteetse to Jack Creek Campground, on the Greybull, is long and rough, but as per usual, there was not a single other campsite taken. This is incredible to me given how close it is to the hordes nearby in Yellowstone. The scenery is incredible, the river looks like a classic, western blue-ribbon trout stream, and the grizzly bears are, apparently, plentiful. Jack Creek campground is a place I wanted to stay for a week, and fortunately, the fishing lived up to its promise.\nThis was by far, the most enjoyable experience of the whole trip. The evening we arrived, I fished the river almost behind my campsite and immediately caught a few nice cutthroat. There were fish rising everywhere, and it’s clear the river doesn’t see a lot of pressure. The next morning I fished again, and again caught quite a few fish. The Greybull is extremely slick to wade, and I kept an eye out for grizzlies, but the fishing was amazing. My catch rate was high, the average fish size was probably about 12 inches, with a few pushing 15. These fishing experiences are so enjoyable, but they make for a short story: arrived, got a nice campsite, and caught a lot of fish in beautiful scenery.\n Greybull River in the morning.\n\n\n\nI went back to the eastern slope of the Wyoming Range in mid-September, after my summer trip. And, just like my summer trip, I made the mistake of not going to LaBarge Creek. The reason for this is that we wanted to do a backpacking trip, and there is no backpacking along LaBarge Creek, only driving. Instead, I decided we would hike up North Piney Creek, and I assumed, like the Utah rivers I’m familiar with, that increasing elevation would increase the cutthroat to non-cutthroat ratio.\n The east slope of the Wyoming Range in fall.\nWe only had a weekend, and work delays meant we left too late on Friday. We arrived at the North Piney Creek trailhead too late in the day to get very far up the river, though I met a guy coming down the trail who had fished. He assured me he caught some cutthroats, though also gave me an ominious warning about the start of hunting season. It turned out that after hiking up the trail about two miles, we hiked directly into hunters who parked at a higher trailhead reachable on a quad or side-by-side. In other words, by going up the drainage away from the main road, we actually hiked into the crowds. We inadvertently setup camp nearly in the dark very close to a staging area. This meant we woke up at about five a.m. to the sound of quads and hunters talking. Not a great camping experience!\nThe night we arrived, I managed to fish for a few minutes before dark and I caught a lot of fish. Unfortunately, they were all five inch brook trout. It’s my understanding that back East a lot of people pursue brookies and view them with reverance, but I absolutely loathe them. They don’t belong in the West, they never get very big in western rivers, and there always seem to be a million of them when trying to catch a native fish.\nThe next morning we hiked farther up North Piney Creek, but the water got very small very quickly, and I didn’t have much fishing success. The number of hunters and off-road vehicles was a legitimate issue too as it was a total zoo in the area. I also hunt and have no moral objection to it, though I get annoyed with the use of gas-powered vehicles to cover ground in the backcountry. We decided to hike out and try our luck elsewhere. Hilariously, at the trailhead off the main forest road, and below where all the hunters drove onto the trail, there was a bull elk bugling like crazy from some pine trees.\nWe drove from North Piney to North Cottonwood. As in the summer, my plan was to use the road along North Cottonwood to connect over to Greys River Road, then out to Alpine, and back to Cache Valley. I was also hoping that because the creek was right along a road there would be fewer hunters. That was a poor assumption. Nearly every plausible dispersed campsite was taken and we were forced to camp in what was essentially a turnout along the road. The good news is that I had all day to catch at least one cutthroat from North Cottonwood Creek, which the Wyoming Game and Fish says is “one of the state’s finest fly-fishing streams,” and one in which Colorado River cutthroat are “common.”\nIt is definitely full of brook trout. For hours I caught dozens of them. As usual, the average size was about eight inches and it’s just not very satisfying fishing. It was getting dark and I was getting frustrated. I began to suspect that the cutthroat were deeper in the water column but I really wanted to use a dry fly to catch one. But, every cast on top of the water just brought up brooks. This is an experience I’ve had in a number of places with small, aggressive fish attacking the surface, but larger fish remaining deeper. Eventually, I think I just got lucky. I cast to an undercut bank and my dry fly got sucked under the surface, maybe only a foot, if that. I hooked a fish and it immediately looked different. I had caught my Colorado River cutt.\nWere I to do this experience today, I would pretty quickly switch to a dry-dropper, or even just a pure nymph setup. At the time, I didn’t really use nymphs or dropper setups effectively, and was really stuck on trying to fish exclusively with drys. I’ve also gotten better at using a dry similar to a wet fly by allowing it to sink. This is most effective on very small creeks by allowing the dry to float through the whitewater then sink into a hole. I’ve even begun tying my version of a wet fly modeled after an Adams, but without any hackle to allow it to better sink. When fishing it, I don’t add any floatant and after it soaks, the fly will start to sink a little, especially when it encounters whitewater or riffles. This can be very effective at getting the fly just deep enough to entice a trout sitting at the bottom of a hole on a small creek. The trout still needs to move up, so it isn’t the same as nymphing where one attempts to get the fly all the way down to the fish, but I think it simulates a floating bug that may have just gotten sucked underneath the current a bit. North Cottonwood may be slightly too big of water to do this effectively, but I could imagine allowing a fly to sink just six inches or so under an undercut bank. In fact, this is almost exactly how I caught my cutt, though it wasn’t purposeful when I did it on North Cottonwood. Does this count as dry fly fishing? Not really, but I can say I caught all my Wyoming fish, as with all my Utah fish, on dry flies, even if they were not always floating.\n Over McDougal Gap in September. Compare this picture without smoke to the one above.\n\n\n\nPerhaps part of the reason why the Greybull was so enjoyable is that once I caught my fish the evening I arrived, the pressure was off. It was the last stop before I went home, and I had caught three of the four. Again, the lesson (for me, anyway) seems to be not to rush things. I wish I could have stayed longer at each spot and really learned the river or creek. As I mentioned, I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I’ve had some amazing experiences on that water because I’ve been able to explore it more and understand the fish in the creek better. When fishing for an evening or morning on the way to the next spot, one doesn’t get to unlock the fishing on a particular water at all.\nOn the other hand, most of us have jobs, families, regular lives to live, and we can’t spend three or four days in one spot if we’re trying to finish the slam. Perhaps two full nights at each spot is optimal, but that means eight nights, not including driving days. And, if catching a particular species isn’t successful, then one has to decide pretty quickly whether they are going to move on, or burn all their time working on one fish.\nThe Wyoming slam was the first state slam established and remains the most famous for a reason. The driving was a hassle, especially through Yellowstone at the height of summer. I had done it a few years before and promised myself never again, then I did it again. This time, I really won’t do it again. But, Western Wyoming is an amazing place and there is so much to do and see besides Teton and Yellowstone. My trip didn’t even touch the Bighorns or Wind River range. I would love to go back to the Meeteetse area and fish the Greybull again, but also the Wood and the smaller creeks in that area. It was rumored that Fenn’s Treasure was hidden in the Wood River drainage, though recent reports suggest it was in Yellowstone National Park, to the west of the Shoshone National Forest, where most of the Greybull and Wood River drainages are located.\nPerhaps because I live in Utah, the Wyoming slam felt bigger, more interesting, and more classically “western.” There weren’t any tiny, brushy creeks on this trip, and though I didn’t go to any of the really famous Wyoming waters, the fishing was mostly very good. The rivers are big, but not too big, the pressure is light, the campgrounds are quiet, and the scenery is excellent.\nIn some ways the Wyoming Cutt Slam is easier than the Utah version because the fishing is a little more straightforward, with the exception of the Colorado River Cutt. I think LaBarge Creek is the obvious place to go now, though I’ve read reports online that it can sometimes be difficult fishing. I fished it in the Tri-Basin Divide once, after I’d completed my slam, and I caught some small cutts without too much difficulty.\nThe Bonneville could also be a little tricky if the Smiths Fork or Hobble Creek don’t work, and in both of those you’ll have to fight through the browns, and possibly rainbows or brooks. I know nothing about the other creeks listed on the Fish and Game’s website, but when researching this trip, they didn’t seem like good options for one reason or another.\nThe logistics in Wyoming are more difficult than Utah however, and if for some reason you struck out on a particular river and had to come back, it’s likely going to be a lot of travel time. I also got relatively lucky with the weather, with the only real challenge coming on the Greys where it was very hot. The air quality in the Wyoming Range was not great due to smoke, but fly fishing is not aerobic so it wasn’t a big deal other than obscuring some of the scenery. Summers in the West are increasingly unpredictable and very hot weather, fires, smoke, or heavy rain can derail plans. For these reasons, I think Utah is still probably the easier first cutt slam to attempt, but it’s close between the two.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "Rock Creek, near Logan, UT.\nI haven’t been fly fishing for that long; I grew up in Southern California which is not exactly a hotbed of trout fishing. I occassionally rod-and-reel fished when camping in the Sierras and in school at the University of Colorado. It was only when I moved to Utah in 2016 that I began serious fly fishing. It helps that I had a skilled mentor who taught me his style. My first summer of fly fishing, I mostly didn’t catch a thing, and I got so frustrated I kind of gave up one it.\nUtah introduced it’s Cutt Slam shortly after I improved as an angler, and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. it forced me to learn more about the fish, explore waters I normally wouldn’t fish, and challenge myself by learning new techniques to tackle new waters.\nWhile I extensively researched the places where I’d try to catch fish for my challenge, I was frustrated with the information on the internet. I found most websites to be full of fish pictures and short on details. This made things difficult for me because I was unsure how to prepare, what kinds of flies to use (though I think this is largely overrated), what kind of water I’d be fishing, in some cases where or how to access the streams. Most importantly, I wanted to have a good experience: good fishing with small crowds, nice scenery, etc. As a result, this site is short on pictures but I hope, long on details. For most of us, it isn’t feasible to drive four hours to a fishing spot and not be successful. I think a lot of the websites suggest that potential anglers have unlimited time and money to catch fish. I also don’t show fish pictures that often,and mostly focus on the water and scenery. When researching my own slams I wanted to know what the water looked like to get a sense of size, type, etc. I know what fish look like.\nA summary of my completed and in progress slams can be found here. I provide details on where and how I caught my fish."

    "section": "",
    "text": "##Background on the Nevada Native Fish Slam\nI have completed four slams, including the Western Native Fish Challenge. I debate whether the Wyoming or Utah slam was easier to finish, but I am absolutely certain about which one is the most difficult. Nevada has it all–long driving distances, small, brushy creeks, difficult to find and catch fish, and unlike Utah and Wyoming which require catching four fish, Nevada has six(!) in its slam. Though California also requires six, I found the fishing much easier.\nI have not completed the Nevada slam, and according to their angler recognition program, fewer than 30 people have ever completed it in the ten years or so it’s been around. I have caught three of the six, and I’m comfortable saying that it is just very, very difficult. But in my mind, this also makes it the most interesting and impressive!\nOf the three fish I’ve caught, the first took me almost a full day and a half fishing in the middle of nowhere, the second was an absolute miracle, and third required a backpack into the mountains to get to the fish. Nevada also refers to their contest as a “fish slam” rather than a “trout slam” because two of the fish are not trout. Bull trout is characterized as a char, while mountain whitefish is a different kind of salmonid. I admittedly don’t understand enough about fish biology to know the differences between these species.\nAt the time I started my slam, Nevada provided significantly less information on where to find native fish than either Wyoming or Utah. Their online resources have since improved, but in 2019 the information on the webpage was literally a typewritten pdf file describing where each species could be found. I had to cross-reference that list with accessible waters, what they looked like, how fishable they were likely to be, and what access was like. I was rightly concerned about high levels of brush and impassable roads. One resource I have found to be helpful is Nevada’s annual Trophy Fish book, which can be found via the webpage here. The book lists people who have completed the slam each year and, importantly, where they caught their fish. Though the book changes every year, I was able to access old copies by editing the url. I used the waters frequently mentioned in the book to target my search.\n\nBonneville Cutthroat–Hendry’s Creek\nAs with my two previous completed slams (Utah and Wyoming), the Bonneville was the first fish I caught in Nevada. The fish exists in a few isolated mountain streams on the east side of the state, and while it wasn’t a short drive for me to get to the Great Basin National Park area, this was about the closest, easily catcheable fish. The Yellowstone is closer to me, but I hadn’t yet figured out how I was going to catch it. I also happened to be camping in central Utah, so I decided to make a one night detour out to Nevada.\nThe mountains in Nevada are unique because they tend to be long, narrow and rise steeply up from the Great Basin. Nevada is the dryest state in the country due to rain-shadowing from the Sierra Nevada, but it’s amazing how quickly the scenery can change with a little elevation. Utah is not too different, but the mountains tend to be a little bigger and a little wider, not giving the same overall feeling that Nevada mountains do of being “sky islands”. The Great Basin, especially in the northern part of the state, looks unlike almost anywhere else I’ve been in the world.\nThe amazing thing to me about the Bonneville trout in Nevada is that the streams disappear into the desert when they come out of the mountains. The fish traveled up these creeks as Lake Bonneville shrunk, then disappeared, and they’ve been there ever since, living in just a few miles of tiny creeks.\nHendry’s Creek is perhaps the easiest creek to access to catch the Bonneville as its accessible by a mostly okay forest road with dispersed camping nearby. One may also fish the creeks in the national park itself, but I’d been to Great Basin before and didn’t want to pay the entrance fee while also worrying about finding a campsite. Some of the best target waters in the park had burned recently as well. It also seemed like Hendry’s Creek was almost a sure thing. One of the reports I read online suggested the guy rolled up to the creek, got out of his truck, caught his fish and left. I did not have the same success.\nThere is an obvious parking area at the end of the forest road very near the creek. The forest road itself is barely passable with a high-clearance two wheel drive vehicle. The creek near the parking area is small, but not particularly brushy and made for relatively easy casting. Unfortunately, there was no evidence fish existed in the creek. I didn’t bring a fish up, didn’t see a fish, and certainly didn’t hook a fish. I walked upstream, as I always do, and had no success. My original plan was to catch the fish and drive home, but it became clear that I’d have to stay another night. I found one of the dispersed campsites and set up there, with one another site just below me also taken, though I don’t think the area sees a lot of traffic.\n Start of the trail up Hendry’s Creek.\nIn fly fishing, like many things, when in doubt, go higher. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t, but I believe it works, so it’s one of my go-to moves if I’m not catching fish. After not catching anything the night before, and thinking that perhaps the fish had moved higher up the creek because it was June and too warm down low, I got on my mountain bike and rode up the trail to the wilderness boundary. Bikes are not allowed in wilderness areas (though horses are, which makes no sense to me), so I walked from there. One of the issues with Hendry’s is that the ditch in which the creek runs is quite steep and brushy, so in many places it isn’t that easy to access the creek. From above, you can also look down into the creek and presumably see fish, if there were any there. I saw no fish.\n There is a creek with fish in there somewhere.\nDespite the lack of visual confirmation, I decided–at basically a random spot–that I was high enough and I should start fishing. Spots were few and far between but I got down into the creek and dapped or flipped my fly into a few holes. After maybe an hour of this, I hooked a fish and almost immediately lost it, giving me flashbacks to Onemile Creek. I can often tell when a fish isn’t hooked well and I tried to be gentle, but it came off. This is a common occurrence fly fishing, and even though you only have to catch one fish to count for a slam, you often end up “catching” more because you lose a few. It’s frustrating but part of the deal. But, at least there were fish somewhere in the creek.\nI fished on and on, and finally hooked another. I was beginning to get worried, and because I lost the first fish, I aggressively flung the second fish nearly onto the trail. This was not easy fishing, and I’m not sure how quickly others have caught their fish in Hendry’s, but I struggled. Getting in and out of the little drainage to get around brush was tough, finding holes to dap into was tough, and catching the fish was tough. In fact, identifying holes where there might be a fish was easy, but getting to the hole and actually catching the fish was a struggle. I stopped fishing almost immediately after I had my fish. The scenery was fine, as the mountains had some nice red rocks and pine trees higher up the trail.\n My fish came out of this hole, which was approximately six inches across and three inches deep.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 1\nMost people completing the Nevada slam will come from the west side of the state because that is where the population centers are. For them, the Lahontan will be easier because it is native to drainages that flow toward or near the west side of the state. Unfortunately for me, it is more difficult to access the Lahontan from the east side as one inevitably has to drive across half the state to access waters in which it’s likely more difficult to catch the fish as compared to western rivers such as the Truckee. For most people then, my situation will not apply because the obvious answer is just to fish the Truckee in Reno.\nI dislike driving long distances so I sought the water farthest to the east that holds Lahontans and settled on the Marys River which flows out of the Jarbidge Mountains toward the Humboldt River east of Elko. This was a mistake. Had I gone farther, to the Elko area, there are creeks with Lahontans that flow off the east side of the Independence Mountain Range, and one in particular, Gance Creek, shows up in a lot of articles as an easy place to catch them. But, because I tried to save myself some driving time, I drove north from the 80 onto a dirt road for almost 40 miles. Outside of Wells it starts as Metropolis Road and passes the abandoned mining town of Metropolis, then continues on as Deeth-O’Neil County Road. The town of Metropolis is worth a stop, and the plaque explains that it died from a combination of getting cut-off from its water supply, a plague of jackrabbits, and mormon crickets. A bit of an ignominious death.\nAt the turnoff from Deeth-O’Neil Road, I had to cross the river on a bridge, go up and over a hill, across a plateau, then over another small ridge, and drop back down to the river miles upstream. The road was well-maintained until the plateau section, and where it drops back down to the river. It is very steep in this area, with some small, muddy creek crossings. I would only attempt this drive in a high-clearance vehicle, and though I did it with two wheel drive, it seemed iffy. Once at the river, there are a number of nice dispersed campsites. The area is somewhat well-used but the night I was there, only one other group was camping well away from us.\n Near lower Marys River. There were no trout here but the scenery was nice.\nThe Marys River in this area looked fishable. I was worried there wouldn’t be enough water as I was there in early September, but the river was bigger than I thought. It looked a little stagnant in places, but I didn’t see any reason why there wouldn’t be trout. To make a long story short, there weren’t any trout in the river. I fished without success, spent the night, and faced a decision. Should I continue looking for trout, or move on to another creek? T Creek was on the same road I came in on, and also is supposed to hold Lahontan, so I thought I’d try that. That also proved to be futile, and it was much harder fishing because it was so small and brushy. It occurred to me to go higher, but I wasn’t sure how much higher I had to go, and this was a brief weekend trip so I was facing some time pressure. On my way back to Utah, I wanted to stop in the northeast corner of Nevada and try to catch a Yellowstone.\n\n\nYellowstone Cutthroat–Goose Creek\nI abandoned the search for a Lahonton and made the decision to head toward Goose Creek. This was another long drive out, through the town of Jackpot for gas, then across another set of dirt roads to the Goose Creek area. As the Nevada DWF makes a point of saying, the Yellowstone will likely be the hardest fish to catch because it exists in only a few creeks and they are all on private land. I really didn’t want to figure out how to ask for permission, so I had a strategy. The first creek I would come across on the road was Little Goose Creek, and using Caltopo and OnX, it looked like there might be some public access to the water. Then, if I could cross a small piece of private, I could access a small canyon through which Little Goose flowed and was entirely public.\nLittle Goose Creek crosses the road at an intersection of two well maintained dirt roads. The creek was small but not brushy and looked somewhat deep. I was hoping I’d get lucky here, catch the fish in a few minutes and be able to leave. I began walking up Little Goose, casting my dry fly, but having no success. I’m pretty sure this was public land but very quickly, I came to posted private land that I wasn’t willing to cross, so that was that for Little Goose Creek. I got back in my truck and headed toward Trout Creek.\nI had read that this entire area belonged to one family with a few ranches. I’d also read a report online of another angler saying they caught their Yellowstone in Trout Creek, which flows into Goose Creek. That angler reported using a dispersed campsite made available by the ranch on Trout Creek. That is where I was headed, though I was somewhat apprehensive about using a campsite supposedly available to the public. As I turned onto the road up Trout Creek, I was greeted with this sign.\n A very warm welcome to anglers!\nSo, was I allowed to fish on Trout Creek or not? It would be easy to deny I was an environmentalist if questioned, but the top sign indicates sportsmen are welcome, while the bottom sign indicates they are not. I remained apprehensive, but sure enough, a few miles up Trout Creek road was what looked to be a campsite. We stopped there, and I drove up higher on the creek to fish that evening. I tried to drive as high as I could, but eventually the road disintegrated to such a point that I started fishing and walking up river. There was no evidence of fish, though a bull elk was bugling very close to where I was fishing.\n Trout Creek did not live up to its name.\nThe area has surprisingly nice scenery, looking like a mix between high desert and pine forest. That night I tried to decide whether I should go up even higher on Trout Creek or head over to Goose Creek, the main water in which Yellowstones inhabit in Nevada. Given my complete lack of success on Trout Creek, and the fact that I needed to start driving home, I decided to head to Goose Creek. How I was going to fish it was unclear because it is, apparently, all on private property, though it does flow under the road and I was hoping I could just fish off the road.\nThis is where things get interesting. The next morning I drove out, toward Utah and Goose Creek. At a large meadow, the creek flows under the road. I stopped and tried to decide what to do. There was nothing posted that indicated it was private property, and I considered simply walking down to the creek and fishing. I started setting up my rod and immediately saw a cloud of dust on the road in the distance. Was it possible someone was coming to intercept me? I saw that it was a guy in side-by-side with dogs herding cattle. I jumped in my truck and drove down the road to meet him. Our conservation was as follows: “Hey, is this your land?” He looked at me suspiciously and said, “yep.” “Do you mind if I fish in the creek?” His response seemed to indicate that I was out of my mind. “Uh, I guess you can, just watch out for the cattle, I’ll be moving them over there.” In fact, he seemed so skeptical I wondered what the deal was and asked, “Am I the first person to ask you to fish here?” He said, “no, there have been others every once in awhile.” What was going on here, why was he acting like I was crazy? “Are there fish in there?” His response: “I don’t know.” Oh okay, cool, the rancher doesn’t know if there are fish in his creek.\n Goose Creek does not look like a classic trout stream.\nGoose Creek is possibly the worst looking “trout” stream I’ve seen. It was muddy, the banks had been destroyed by cows, there were pies everywhere, and not a tree in sight. It must have been broiling in the summer. To be fair, it had just rained, so maybe the creek was just blown out, but I think it was the cows. I thought, this is completely futile, there is no way I’m going to catch a fish here.\nI immediately realized a dry wasn’t going to work, so I used a dry dropper, which is almost always how I nymph. Of course, there were no signs of life for about the first half hour or so. It really did seem pointless. The rancher came back at one point and asked me if I caught anything. He turned out to be a nice guy despite being baffled that someone would want to fish Goose Creek. I told him no, he laughed and wished me luck, and drove off in his side-by-side.\nIncredibly, shortly after, I felt a fish on my nymph and nearly lost my mind. I couldn’t see the fish until it was almost on the bank because it was so muddy, and at first I thought it was a whitefish it was so pale. It was a large cutthroat, something like 15 inches. I can’t believe a fish that big can survive in that water. I really wish I could tell the rancher that there are indeed large fish in his creek, but I didn’t see him again.\n Yellowstone trout and cow pie from Goose Creek.\nI have no idea how I pulled that off, and I suspect I could spend another week there and not catch another fish. I’m not sure what advice to offer to others. NDOW offers the not terribly helpful advice to ask for permission to fish on Goose Creek at one of the ranch houses. I didn’t see any ranch houses anywhere near the road as everything seemed to be fenced off. In other words, had I not run across the rancher in his side-by-side, I don’t know how I would have asked for permission. I interpret the sign and campsite on Trout Creek as providing permission to fish that water, but I couldn’t catch a fish there. I’m guessing I was maybe two or three miles from the Idaho border, so the fish might just be up higher. Or perhaps, I just needed to fish it longer. It looks like parts of Trout Creek lie on public land very close to the Idaho border. An app like OnX would help immensely as when I was fishing it I couldn’t determine where I was in relation to the public land or the border. The best option, absent asking permission, might be to fish Little Goose Creek for the stretch on which it flows through public land. Maps like CalTopo show public land access to a portion of the creek off the road.\nIn short, I’m glad I don’t have to catch a second Yellowstone cutt in Nevada.\n\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Marys River, Attempt 2\nNevada has some odd bureaucratic requirements for completing the slam. First, they used to require the angler take a picture with their fish. This requirement seems to have vanished from their updated webpages. Second, the angler must print off their form for each fish as they catch it, then mail it to NDOW with the picture. I received an email confirming my submission, and after submitting my Yellowstone, another emailed confirmation from an NDOW employee and a compliment on my fish. I emailed back and told him about striking out on the Marys. His response indicated that the trout are up much higher, which I took to mean the Jarbidge Mountains, the source of the Marys.\nThe Jarbidge Mountains are an undiscovered jem. The Marys River flows out of a drainage on the south side of the mountains, into the Humboldt River and Great Basin, while the Jarbidge River flows off the north side, toward the Snake River, and eventually into the Columbia and to the Pacific. The Jarbidge River is home to bull trout and redband, two of which are required for the Nevada slam, and neither of which I have yet caught. My goal on this trip was the Lahontan.\n The Jarbidge Mountains are a spectacular slice of northern Nevada.\nTo get to the Marys River headwaters, we backpacked in from the Camp Draw trailhead. The forest road coming from the south is good, and connects over the mountains into the town of Jarbidge on the north side of the range. We were there in June, shortly after a late season storm, and the road was wet and muddy in places, but passable. In dry weather, it should be no problem even for sedans. The backpack down to the Marys was fairly short and easy, and we saw two different herds of elk in the mountains. Unsurprisingly, over a three night backpack, we saw no one else in the mountains or at the parking lot.\n We spooked a herd of cow and calf elk.\nWe found an already established campsite right along the river, and I fished only very briefly in the evening. The Marys River was more like a creek here and though parts of it were brushy, most of it looked like good water. There were overhanging branches, some deep pools, and soft spots in the river. It looked like I should easily catch a few fish, except I didn’t. Even when I’m not catching fish, I can usually see evidence of them, like feeding at the surface or fish spooking as I wade upstream. If I don’t see any fish darting away from me as I wade, I get concerned, and I didn’t see anything as I worked upstream. The next morning I decided to hike upstream farther and get higher, though I was already in the headwaters. The most surprising thing about this campsite is that there were a lot of ticks near the river. (Ticks in Nevada, who knew!)\nThe next morning I hiked upstream and as the trail parallels the river, it was easy to look for likely fishing spots. At one spot, amidst the downfall, I could see fish. Finally, the Lahontan in the Marys River! Unless they were brook trout. It was tough getting down to the river, and there was a lot of deadfall which prevented easy wading. I worried that I would only get a few casts before the fish I saw spooked, so I needed to make them count. Sure enough, after about two or three casts, I hooked my Lahonton.\nI was with other people who were more interested in backpacking than watching me fish, so I stopped fishing after that. I also had another goal in mind. If we continued on that trail, we could go up and over a pass, leave the Marys River drainage and enter the Jarbidge River drainage. There I could attempt to catch either a bull trout or redband and bag another fish for my Nevada slam, though if I didn’t get both I’d have to come back to the area anyway.\n Looking down into the Jarbidge River drainage.\nThe hiking was fairly easy to get over the pass, though the north facing slope, down into the Jarbidge River drainage, was still holding quite a bit of snow. We made it a few miles down the Jarbidge River and I tried to do some fishing, but it was still running high and fast, and the gradient was extremely steep. This made it difficult to find holes, and I think I needed to hike lower to find suitable fishing spots. We didn’t do this because we were running out of daylight, and every mile farther down we hiked would be another mile we’d have to hike back up and out. I didn’t catch either a redband or a bull trout, but the Marys River Lahontan has me with three of the six fish needed for the Nevada Native Trout Challenge. I wasn’t able to fish in Nevada in 2023 or 2024 as I spent most of my free time completing the California Heritage Trout Challenge 23, and wasn’t able to fish much in 24. This is my first priority in 2025, however.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "California is my home state and the place where I first learned to rod-and-reel fish. I made semi-annual camping trips with my family into the Sierra, and sometimes caught fish, which we almost always kept and ate. Some of my best fishing memories are in Kennedy Meadows of the Southern Sierra, fishing the South Fork of the Kern. I also had family in the Kernville area, and fished the mainstem Kern a number of times growing up, though I can’t remember having much success on that river, aside from when the planting truck would pull up and dump fish into the river.\nBecause California has high state capacity and a professionalized legislature, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has published a very fancy, glossy brochure that discusses each fish and where to find them. The brochure somewhat confusingly lists twelve total “heritage” trout that exist or existed in California, though anglers only have to catch six to complete the challenge. One of those fish, bull trout, has been extirpated from the state. That leaves eleven.\nA second fish, the Paiute Trout, has a native range comprised of a small set of creeks that are closed to fishing because the fish is listed under the Endangered Species Act. While anglers can and do catch the fish in other drainages to which they’ve been transported (apparently in the White Mountains), these fish do not qualify for the Heritage Trout Challenge because they are outside their native drainage. The Heritage Trout Challenge brochure teases that it is possible to catch a Paiute below the closure as fish may wash downstream. I’ve done some research and seen others hint at this possibility, but I don’t know if it’s realistic or not. Assuming it’s not currently possible to catch a Pauite, that seemingly leaves ten total fish.\nEven more confusingly, the brochure lists a second recognition level, that of “Master Angler”, if one catches all eleven species, but that includes the Paiute cutthroat. My impression is that the brochure was published prior to the closure of the Silver Creek drainage, home of the Pauite, so I’m not sure it’s possible to complete the Master Angler level. References to the Master Angler level seem to have been completely scrubbed from any current online sources."

    "title": "How I Fish",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every angler has their own style, techniques, and preferred ways of doing things. Mine are simply the result of how I learned to fly fish, and adjustments that I’ve made over the years. None of my advice or descriptions are meant to be prescriptive as I’m a big believer in learning to fish your own fish (borrowed from the expression, “hike your own hike”), but I think understanding some basic, fundamental strategies are helpful, especially for new anglers.\n\nFish Upstream\nI fish upstream about 99% of the time. That is, I begin downstream of wherever I think my endpoint will be, and work upstream. If I’m finishing along a road and park in a turnout, I usually fish upstream from my car, then walk back downstream on the road when I’m finished. I do this because I believe most anglers walk downstream from their car, then fish upstream back to their car. If people consistently park in the same turnout, the stretch of water downstream of the car will see more pressure than that upstream, and I always want to fish water with less fishing pressure.\nI fish upstream for a few reasons. First, as the name suggests, I fish with dry flies if at all possible, though this is changing a little bit (see below). I think the “float” or presentation of the dry fly is more natural when you cast upstream and let it float back to you, rather than casting downstream and have it float away from you. Maybe this is only due to my own, admittedly poor technique fishing downstream, but I feel like trying to feed line as a fly floats downstream just looks less natural.\nSecond, fish almost always face upstream into the current. When you approach downstream, the fish are looking away from you and are less likely to spook. This is probably not as big of an issue on larger rivers, but most of my fishing is done on small rivers and creeks where the fish can easily see you if you get too close to their field of vision. A valid counterpoint to this is that if you cast upstream, the fish see the line, leader, and tippet go over their field of vision before they see the fly. If you cast downstream (and the fish face upstream), they see the fly first. This must be true, but I don’t think the fish care much about seeing line in the water, and I think they care a lot about seeing a person moving around. It’s also the case that often when wading you stir up dirt and debris and this can cause off-color water to move downstream. If you’re fishing upstream this is irrelevant because the fish will never know.\nFinally, if a fish takes the fly and you’re downstream of the fish, when you set the fly you are setting it back into the fish’s mouth which produces a better hook set and makes it more likely you land the fish. If you’re fishing downstream, setting the hook pulls the fly away from the fish’s mouth and toward the angler, increasing the chances you’ll simply pull the fly out of the fish’s mouth.\nAlso, it’s harder to net a fish by bringing it upstream to you because you’re fighting the current, which makes it more likely you’ll break your trippet. It is much easier to bring it downstream toward you,especially in fast moving water.\nThe only exception to my fishing upstream rule is when I use a streamer. My streamer technique is standard and basic: I cast across and down, or just down if the water is narrow, and pull the line back toward me by hand (without reeling in). I almost never fish this way however, mostly because I stink at this technique. I’m sure I’ve caught fewer than five trout on a streamer.\n\n\nCast Short\nThe vast majority of my fishing is done on small and medium size waters. The Logan is the biggest river I normally fish and it has a summer streamflow of around 100 cfs. Compare that a famous western river like the Madison which has a flow over 1,000 cfs above Bozeman. Because of the sizes of my regular waters, I make very short casts, usually shorter than 20 feet, and often closer to ten feet. This is contrary to the idealized image of fly fishing, which is at least partially due to the dramatic fishing shots in A River Runs Through It.\n Casting in the movies.  Casting in real life.\nThe longer your line, the more likely it is you’re going to get something tangled, pile your line on your fly at the end of the cast, or just be inaccurate with you put your fly. To me, there is a direct trade-off between casting accuracy and how much line you’re trying to cast. If you shorten your line, you’re much more likely to put the fly where you want it. And, that’s really the most important thing. I find that if I cast to a spot and make a bad cast, either by presenting the fly poorly, or putting it in the wrong area, I can probably try again and still bring the fish up. But if I do that more than two or three times, the fish will spook and I’ll have lost my chance. The thing that separates really good anglers from average anglers (I am decidedly in the average camp), is that they can make an accurate cast with good presentation to a spot the first time. It might take me two or three or four casts to get the same result, and with each successive catch, the greater the chance the fish will vanish. But even the best casters get less accurate with distance. A friend of mine related a story in which he was trying to make a complicated cast across the water when another friend said, “Are you trying to fish that hole over there? If so, just walk over there and cast into it.” That’s good advice.\n\n\nKeep Moving\nWhen I fished as a kid, and even when I started to learn to fly fish, I would stand in the same spot and cast repeatedly to the same area, sometimes for hours. Looking back, I can’t believe I did this. If a fish didn’t come up for the first fifty casts, why would it come up in the next fifty? As I’ve become better at spotting fish underwater, I also realize that trout will spook after a few casts over their hole. They’ll either move somewhere else, or go to the bottom of their hole and stay there. I’m now a believer in the idea that a hole gets five casts or so, maybe a few more if you’ve got good reason to believe there is a fish in the hole and you haven’t yet spooked it. After that, I move on.\nThe person who taught me to fly fish has an even stricter rule–he makes two or maybe three casts then moves on. I tend to give a spot a little bit more time than that, but not much more. Sometimes if I feel like I haven’t quite hit the spot I’m looking for, and haven’t totally blown the hole by splashing my fly or line all over it, I’ll keep casting into it. But, even five or six casts takes me no more than a minute. After that, I’ll cast to a different spot.\nBy moving, I mean that I wade the river, cast to likely spots a few times, then walk upriver to the next spot. On a river like the Logan, which is full of rocks and holes, I can move only one or two steps laterally or forward to the next spot. On other types of rives that have well-defined holes and riffles, there might be more walking between spots. Either way, I typically cover a lot of water. One of the reasons I get so annoyed with crowded rivers is that it prevents me from moving as much. If I walk upstream and run into another angler, I get out and walk way upriver to get clear of that angler as I don’t want to high-hole them.\n\n\nChange Flies, But Not Too Much\nI believe fly selection is largely overrated, and I think it’s an easy way to signal expertise and purposefully confuse new anglers. Yes, I understand that in some situations there might be a hatch that the fish are keying in on, and if you’re on a super famous river with a ton of pressure it might be really important to match the hatch. But, this is not the average experience. In mid-summer dry fly fishing on almost any western river, I feel like I basically need a caddis and a parachute adams, maybe in two or three different colors, and in sizes 12, 14, and 16. That’s 18 different individual flies, and even that seems like too many.\nIf your dry fly isn’t working at all, it might be time to switch flies. If this occurs, I always go smaller as I feel like fish will refuse to bite on flies that are too big, but not too small. It’s rare that you need a bigger fly if your existing fly isn’t working. I also switch colors sometimes, basically dividing flies into drab or bright. If drab isn’t working try bright, and vice versa. A lot of people make claims that say on low light days use drab flies (or maybe it’s other way around) but I’ve never noticed any patterns. A lot of this folk wisdom seems to work great except when it doesn’t. Don’t be inimated by fly selection, 90% of my fishing is done with no more than four or five flies. It isn’t a science, and we shouldn’t pretend like it is. Go with what feels right, if it doesn’t work, switch to something different.\n\n\nAvoid Pressured Fish\nOn most medium to large western rivers, there is going to be a road or trail of some kind that parallels it. There are usually turnouts on the road and obvious holes that every person who drives by is likely to fish. Using the turnouts is mostly unavoidable, as you need somewhere to park. But I never fish the obvious spots. Walking just a little bit, maybe even .5 a mile, away from the turnout and getting into the river at an unassuming spot is likely to yield better fishing. Fish get wise to movement on the bank, bad casts, and poor presentation, and they can be surprisingly picky. By finding a spot that sees even marginally fewer flies, I believe it is far likelier one will have success bringing a fish up.\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "Visiting and Tasting in Tequila, Jalisco, Mexico",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In early 2023, I went with my family to Tequila, Mexico for tequila tasting and sightseeing. I did a lot of research prior to going, mostly on Reddit and other individual blogs, and found they were of some help. I want to detail my experience so others can plan their trip. I can summarize my overall impression by saying, if you’re thinking about doing this, you should; it’s a great trip.\n\n\nWe flew from Tijuana, Mexico to Guadalajara. My family lives in Southern California and it’s much cheaper to cross into Mexico and fly one of the Mexican domestic carriers than it is to fly from the U.S. For most people, this won’t be possible, but most major U.S. airlines fly to Guadalajara. The Guadalajara airport is nice and fairly large, and it was an easy trip from the airport into the city by taxi for about $20. We bought the taxi ride from a stand inside the airport, as you should always do in Mexico, rather than hailing a taxi from the curb. A few sources online suggested that Uber was not available at the Guadalajara airport, but when I signed on, there were a number of cars available. We used the taxi because the stand was right in the baggage claim area and it just seemed easier.\nWe were concerned about safety before we left, especially because a few days before the Mexican Government arrested the son of El Chapo, and armed conflict broke out between the cartel and the government in Sinaloa, especially in the city of Culiacan. That city is more than 400 miles from Guadalajara, and we never felt unsafe whatsoever during the day. At night we were advised not to walk around our neighborhood, Colonia Americana, so we didn’t venture farther than about four blocks from the hotel in the evening. One night we had dinner at Alcalde, which was pricey but fantastic, and took an Uber there and back even though it was only about one mile each way, within walking distance for us.\nGuadalajara is an interesting and lively city, and it is worth staying a night or two there before heading to Tequila. We stayed three nights and that was probably one night too many. We had plans to see a rodeo, but all sporting events and some other public activities were canceled because of the violence. This was a one-off, unusual event, and not something that happens regularly. All the standard attractions in Guadalajara listed on other travel guides are worth visiting, so I won’t go into details about those here.\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, the vast majority of American tourists end up day-tripping from Guadalajara to Tequila. I think this is a mistake, as I really liked spending two nights in the town itself. The famous Jose Cuervo Tequila Train only runs on weekends, so we weren’t able to do that. From what I could gather, the train takes people into the town, lets them visit the Cuervo factory, walk around town, then takes them back to Guadalajara. I much preferred having some time to spend in the town itself.\nWe took an Uber from near the center of Guadalajara to Tequila. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes, and cost us $60. Getting back from Tequila to Guadalajara is trickier because there are not a lot of Ubers in Tequila. We ended up hiring a driver through our guide, which cost us $100. There are two other options: hire a taxi in Tequila to Guadalajara, if possible. There are taxis in town, but I’m not sure they’d be willing to drive all the way back or how much it would cost. The other option is the bus which goes from the Tequila bus station, close to the main tourist part of town, and stops at various stations in Guadalajara. The bus leaves every half hour or so all day, and costs only about $10 per person. This was our plan if we were unable to hire a car. The drawback of the bus is that it is slower than a car, and it ends at the central bus station from which you’d have to take an Uber or taxi to your hotel. Also be forewarned: there is often heavy traffic leaving and returning to Guadalajara.\n\n\n\n The town of Tequila, near the main square.\nThe town of Tequila is small and walkable, and felt completely safe. There seemed to be a lot of Mexican tourists drinking and taking tours in buses shaped like tequila barrels, but not many Americans. While there aren’t a ton of sights in the town per se, it’s just a nice place to walk around, hang out, and kill some time. There are distilleries/factories near the downtown area, and a ton of bars and shops; it’s kind of like a tamer version of walking the Vegas strip. If you want to go from shop to shop and bar to bar tasting tequila on the street, you’re in luck. Cantarito is the mixed drink of the moment, and seems to be quite popular among the locals and tourists. It’s made with tequila, citrus juice, and Squirt, and served in a clay cup. I prefer my tequila neat so tasting one cantarito was enough for me.\n “House” tequila in plastic jugs piling up in a bar.\nThere are a few tequila distilleries/factories in town, and we chose the Sauza tour for no other reason than it came recommended on Reddit. Orendain, Cuervo, and potentially others are possibilities. And again, each bar seems to have its own “house” tequila that you can taste. The Sauza tour was fine and we got free tequila drinks at the end. We made a reservation but some of them (maybe Orendain?) don’t require reservations. Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila.\n\n\n\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. Most of the guide services I saw only cost roughly $120 per person, though you can reduce individual costs with more people. I liked our guide a lot so please contact me for his information.\n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery.\n\n\n\nThe rules about bringing liquor back into the U.S. are complicated, apparently, and we got stopped at the border after trying to declare our nine bottles. Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings.\n\n\n\n\nThree nights in Guadalajara\n\nStayed at Rame Hotel Boutique\n\nTwo nights in Tequila\n\nStayed at AirBnb\n\nOne night in Tlaquepaque, a suburb of Guadalajara\n\nStayed at La Villa del Ensueno\n\nDistilleries visited\n\nCasa Sauza, in downtown Tequila\nCava del Oro, outside Tequila\nCascahuin, in Arenal outside Tequila\nTres Mujeres, outside Tequila\n\n\nAs I noted above, if one wanted to do this trip in fewer nights, one could do one or two nights in Guadalajara on the front end, two nights in Tequila, then straight back to the airport, or one night back in Guadalajara.

    "text": "Utah introduced its cutt slam shortly after I learned how to consistently catch fish on the fly and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. The slam forced me to learn more about the fish I was catching, explore waters I normally wouldn’t, and challenge myself by learning new techniques to tackle unfamilitar waters.\nWhile I extensively researched the places I’d fish for my challenge, I was frustrated with a lot of the information I read from other sources. I found most websites to be long on fish pictures and short on details. This made things difficult when deciding where and how I’d fish because I was unsure what kinds of flies to use (though I think this is largely overrated), the type of water I’d be fishing, or public access.\nThe most important thing for me when fishing is to have an overall enjoyable experience: good fishing, small crowds, and nice scenery. For most of us, it isn’t feasible to drive four or five hours to a fishing spot, only to realize that there isn’t public access or the creek is full of tiny brook trout. Because of my frustrations with other online information, this site is short on pictures but, I hope, long on details. I mostly skip the grip-and-grin fish pictures, and focus on the water and scenery. When researching my own slams I wanted to know what the water looked like to get a sense of its size and type. In general, I know what fish look like.\n\nN.B.: I know it’s considered by many to be problematic to post locations of good fishing spots, but all the waters described here can be found on the state wildlife agency websites, on other personal websites, and in many Youtube videos so I’m not giving away any secrets. Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com. I hope this information is valuable for others interested in fly fishing and pursuing native trout challenges.\nI also want to note that I receive no compensation from this website, and none of the products I recommend or equipment I use are sponsored.\nA summary of my completed and in progress slams can be found here. I provide details on where and how I caught my fish. Unless otherwise noted, all fish were caught on dry flies and released.

    "text": "Travel to Guadalajara\nWe flew from Tijuana, Mexico to Guadalajara. My family lives in Southern California and it’s much cheaper to cross into Mexico and fly one of the Mexican domestic carriers than it is to fly from the U.S. For most people, this won’t be possible, but most major U.S. airlines fly to Guadalajara. The Guadalajara airport is nice and fairly large, and it was an easy trip from the airport into the city by taxi for about $20. We bought the taxi ride from a stand inside the airport, as you should always do in Mexico, rather than hailing a taxi from the curb. A few sources online suggested that Uber was not available at the Guadalajara airport, but when I signed on, there were a number of cars available. We used the taxi because the stand was right in the baggage claim area and it just seemed easier.\nWe were concerned about safety before we left, especially because a few days before the Mexican Government arrested the son of El Chapo, and armed conflict broke out between the cartel and the government in Sinaloa, especially in the city of Culiacan. That city is more than 400 miles from Guadalajara, and we never felt unsafe whatsoever during the day. At night we were advised not to walk around our neighborhood, Colonia Americana, so we didn’t venture farther than about four blocks from the hotel in the evening. One night we had dinner at Alcalde, which was pricey but fantastic, and took an Uber there and back even though it was only about one mile each way, within walking distance for us.\nGuadalajara is an interesting and lively city, and it is worth staying a night or two there before heading to Tequila. We stayed three nights and that was probably one night too many. We had plans to see a rodeo, but all sporting events and some other public activities were canceled because of the violence. This was a one-off, unusual event, and not something that happens regularly. All the standard attractions in Guadalajara listed on other travel guides are worth visiting, so I won’t go into details about those here."

    "text": "From Guadalajara to Tequila\nAs far as I can tell, the vast majority of American tourists end up day-tripping from Guadalajara to Tequila. I think this is a mistake, as I really liked spending two nights in the town itself. The famous Jose Cuervo Tequila Train only runs on weekends, so we weren’t able to do that. From what I could gather, the train takes people into the town, lets them visit the Cuervo factory, walk around town, then takes them back to Guadalajara. I much preferred having some time to spend in the town itself.\nWe took an Uber from near the center of Guadalajara to Tequila. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes, and cost us $60. Getting back from Tequila to Guadalajara is trickier because there are not a lot of Ubers in Tequila. We ended up hiring a driver through our guide, which cost us $100. There are two other options: hire a taxi in Tequila to Guadalajara, if possible. There are taxis in town, but I’m not sure they’d be willing to drive all the way back or how much it would cost. The other option is the bus which goes from the Tequila bus station, close to the main tourist part of town, and stops at various stations in Guadalajara. The bus leaves every half hour or so all day, and costs only about $10 per person. This was our plan if we were unable to hire a car. The drawback of the bus is that it is slower than a car, and it ends at the central bus station from which you’d have to take an Uber or taxi to your hotel. Also be forewarned: there is often heavy traffic leaving and returning to Guadalajara.\n\nIn Tequila\n The town of Tequila, near the main square.\nThe town of Tequila is small and walkable, and felt completely safe. There seemed to be a lot of Mexican tourists drinking and taking tours in buses shaped like tequila barrels, but not many Americans. While there aren’t a ton of sights in the town per se, it’s just a nice place to walk around, hang out, and kill some time. There are distilleries/factories near the downtown area, and a ton of bars and shops; it’s kind of like a tamer version of walking the Vegas strip. If you want to go from shop to shop and bar to bar tasting tequila on the street, you’re in luck. Cantarito is the mixed drink of the moment, and seems to be quite popular among the locals and tourists. It’s made with tequila, citrus juice, and Squirt, and served in a clay cup. I prefer my tequila neat so tasting one cantarito was enough for me.\n “House” tequila in plastic jugs piling up in a bar.\nThere are a few tequila distilleries/factories in town, and we chose the Sauza tour for no other reason than it came recommended on Reddit. Orendain, Cuervo, and potentially others are possibilities. And again, each bar seems to have its own “house” tequila that you can taste. The Sauza tour was fine and we got free tequila drinks at the end. We made a reservation but some of them (maybe Orendain?) don’t require reservations. Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila."

    "text": "Visiting Other Distilleries\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour.

    "title": "Western Native Trout Challenge",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For whatever reason, I am not as excited for the Western Native Trout Challenge as I am for the state slams. I have been trying to put my finger on why, and I think it has something to do with the idea of becoming fully invested in a state and learning about the different drainages. The WNTC is bigger for sure, but it feels a little more instrumental; it’s kind of like, here’s a list of fish all over the country, go catch them. The best thing about the WNTC challenge is the high quality hat they send you.\nI will also admit that I find the rules incredibly confusing, and I’m wondering whether this sentiment is shared by others. What follows is a wonky discussion, but for those interested, I’ll explain why I think the WNTC rules are flawed. If you don’t care about this, you can skip to the next section.\nThe requirements for the first level, “Expert caster” are simple enough: catch six fish in four different states. After that, things get complicated. To complete the next step, “Advanced caster,” one must catch twelve fish in eight states, though the first six count from the Expert level count. To put it differently, you must repeat the Expert level with different fish species (you submit the fish that you caught for the first level, but you must catch six additional fish and cannot duplicate species for the second level).\nThe problem arises with the limited list of fish provided by each of the states. For example, suppose I wanted to fish in Washington. That state only has three qualifying fish: Redband, Westslope, and Coastal. Each of these fish are native to other states, and in fact I’ve already caught two of these fish for my first level, so I can only use one fish from Washington to advance to the next level of “Advanced caster”.\nNew Mexico only has two fish, one of which is also one of Colorado’s two fish, and the other Colorado fish is the Colorado River cutt, which is on the list for three other states. But, by catching the Colorado River cutt in Utah, I’ve now eliminated Colorado as a state unless I catch the Rio Grande, which in turn eliminates New Mexico as a state. You can catch the same species again and complete the lower “Expert” level for a second time, but it becomes very difficult to plan trips to reach each of the next two steps because one runs out of states pretty quickly. In statistics, we would say there are not enough degrees of freedom to complete each of the three levels without repeating fish (or without going to Alaska).\nI’m betting the challenge was setup this way after bargaining with each state’s Department of Fish and Game, and I imagine each state wants to direct people to certain places and certain fish. But this takes far too much advanced planning and thinking for my taste. What I wish they would have done is made each fish-state combination a possible catch, then just said, to complete the first level catch eight, second is catch 16, third is catch 22 (no pun intended). If one wants to catch a bull trout in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, go for it, that’s three of eight. Or, if an angler wants to catch five in Nevada and three in Utah, that’s enough for the “Expert level”, and reaching the next level requires another eight fish-state combinations. The eight fish requirement would have made the challenge “bigger” than any single state challenge and would have forced people to go to at least two states, and probably more. It also would have simplified things dramatically, and allowed anglers to fish wherever they wanted without having to backward induct where they might be or which fish they might catch in the future.\nTo make this a bit more concrete, I am planning to fish Oregon sometime soon and it would be nice to add some fish to complete the next level of the challenge. Here’s the problem. Oregon has five fish on the list, which is a lot, but none of these will help me reach the “Advanced caster” step. I need to catch a bull trout from Nevada for that state’s challenge, so catching one in Oregon doesn’t do anything for me. Same story for the Coastal Cutthroat, which I need for California’s challenge. The other three, Lahontan, Redband, and Westslope, I have already caught in other states and submitted to complete my first challenge level.\nAs a result, I don’t know when, or even if, I will be able to complete the second level of the challenge. It probably won’t be anytime soon, and I’m planning on directing most of my attention to state challenges.\n\nPreviously Caught Fish\nAs noted above, the WNTC requires six fish across four states. A few of the fish I could use from completing my Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada slams, though I needed to submit a slightly different combination of fish given the Challenge’s rules about different fish from different states.\nFrom previous slams, I submitted a Bonneville from the Logan River, Utah, and the Lahontan from Nevada. More details about my Utah and Nevada slams can be found here.\nThat is two fish from two states. The other two obvious states that I’ve fished quite a bit are Idaho and Wyoming. In Wyoming, the qualifying fish are the Bonneville, Colorado River, Westslope and Yellowstone. The Bonneville was out because I used that fish for Utah. The Westslope is also a a qualifying fish in Idaho, and the Yellowstone is a qualifying fish in Nevada and Wyoming. The only distinct fish between Idaho and Wyoming are the bull trout in Idaho, the Redband in Idaho, and the Colorado River in Wyoming. Basically, I’d need some combination of those fish between those two states. Confused yet?\nBecause I’d already caught Colorado River and Yellowstone cutthroats in Wyoming for the Wyoming slam, I now I had four fish from three states. Perhaps surprisingly, I had not caught any qualifying fish in Idaho. Catching any qualifying fish there (that I wasn’t submitting for another state) would give me five fish and four states, and then I could submit any other fish from any state.\n\n\nAborted Attempt to Fish Near Lincoln, MT\nFish number five I caught in the summer of 2019 during a family trip to Lake Coeur d’Alene. I left a few days early and drove through the eastern part of Idaho into Montana, with plans to fish the Lincoln and Ovando, MT areas. From there, I would pick up the 90, and drive to the Idaho panhandle, fishing some rivers there. This did not work as expected, and in fact, the trip went very poorly, right up to the point where it went great.\nI was not in charge of scheduling the stay on Lake Coeur d’Alene and I was worried about my fishing plan because it was still very early in the season, around June 15th. I suspected the larger rivers like the Blackfoot and Clark Fork would still be blown out, and when I got to the area it was clear they were unfishable. Instead, my planned first stop was a forest service campground on a small creek called Copper Creek. The scenery and campground were nice enough but on arrival, I saw that the drainage had semi-recently burned. As a result, there were downed trees all over the creek. It was almost impossible to wade, and while I’m sure a more determined angler could have made it work, I gave up pretty quickly. The creek was high, the downfall was bad, and I’d driven all day and it was getting dark.\n Copper Creek, Montana. The deadfall and high water made it almost impossible to fish.\n Looking down on the Copper Creek drainage and toward the Scapegoat Wilderness.\nI spent the night in the campground and had plans the next morning to hike to the Landers Fork, which was about two miles from the trailhead near the campground. Two things happened that prevented this. The first is that I very quickly developed a weird cramp in my foot that made hiking difficult. As I was debating whether or not to turn around and hike back to my car, the second thing happened: I saw a relatively fresh, massive grizzly print on the trail. If ever the universe was giving me a sign, this was it. I turned around, got in my car, and left Copper Creek to continue my drive to Idaho.\n Time to turn around! While the mud around the track was dry, the tracks themselves appeared relatively fresh–maybe a week old, at most.\nI have never seen a grizzly up close in the lower 48. I saw a young black bear from about one hundred yards hiking in the Salt River Range in Wyoming, and I saw a black spot, from maybe a mile away, beelining over a pass (and toward me) in the Gros Ventre Range above Granite Hot Springs, WY. I’m not sure it was a grizzly bear, and I’m not even sure it was a bear at all, but it was big and fast, and didn’t move like an ungulate. Incidentally two years later, in 2021, a grizzly attacked and killed a camper in the town of Ovando, MT.\n The Lincoln Ranger office in Lincoln, MT has a very large grizzly bear on display.\n\n\nCoeur d’Alene River–Westslope Cutthroat\nFrom Montana, I drove straight through to the North Fork of the Coeur d’Alene River, but arrived too late in the day to do much fishing. I stopped at Honeysuckle Campground and was the only person staying there. Things were looking up, until I saw that the fee for the campground was $24 a night! How could it be so expensive when no one was there? And come on, that is outrageous for a national forest service campground. I don’t think I’ve ever paid more than about $16 for one of these campgrounds and I refused to pay it on principle. I resolved the next day to leave the campground and find dispersed camping in the area. I had plans to drive over a ridge and down into the Teepee Creek watershed which eventually flows into the mainstem Coeur d’Alene. I’d read online that fishing was good in Teepee and I’ve always enjoyed fishing smaller waters (online sources refer to it as both “Tepee” and “Teepee”).\nThe fishing was decent on Teepee Creek. I packed up camp, made the short drive over to the creek, and began fishing a meadow near a research station of some kind. The water was a little high, and I didn’t have any success on dry flies, so I switched to a dry dropper setup. I lost one nice fish, then hooked another. Regrettably, I took almost no pictures on this trip for some reason, so in lieu of a Teepee Creek picture, here is one of the fish I caught, a 15 inch Westslope cutthroat.\n My first Westslope cutt from Teepee Creek.\nThings began to warm up and I couldn’t get any more action on Teepee Creek so I made the decision to drive farther down the forest road, which would take me back to the mainstem Couer d’Alene, then back out to the junction where the North Fork and Coeur d’Alene meet, just outside of Caltado, Idaho. The drive up the North Fork to Honeysuckle, then over to Teepee, and back down the mainstem makes a big loop. I needed to get back to civilization anyway to make a phone call, and I still had to find a dispersed camping site. Despite being early in the season, both rivers were at summer flows and I made a few stops to fish along the Coeur d’Alene, but I didn’t have any success.\nIt was crowded, as most holes had a guy or two in them, and there were a lot of people driving the road looking for spots. This suggested to me that the river sees a lot of pressure. It’s big enough, but the water miles alongside the road are somewhat limited so I think the fish in the obvious holes see a lot of flies. There are also lots of other people recreating, swimming in the river, wading, etc., which isn’t necessarily the best for fishing. Despite it being mid-June, it was very hot. In fact, the temperature reached 105, or close to it, in the town of Coeur d’Alene which, needless to say, is not good for the fishing. After a few frustrating hours, a lot of which was spent just trying to find some space on the river, I gave up.\nI started back up the road to Honeysuckle Campground, off the mainstem and onto the North Fork to find a spot to disperse camp. There was a tiny turnoff in the road which didn’t look like much but beneath it, in the trees, was an obvious camping area. I found my free spot at last (take that, Recreation.gov). After setting up camp, I walked down to the river in the evening and fished a little. I didn’t have much success until I came to a small, obvious-looking pool that definitely held fish. I caught a few, tiny trout, though a moose did appear out of the timber on the other side of the river from me. Despite the lack of fishing excitement, that was one of those transcendent experiences that make it all worth while; just me and a moose hanging out by the river in the twilight. Shortly after the moose left, I heard a noise from behind me and expected another moose (or a bear), but it was two other fisherman. I’m not even sure where they came from as the road was up the hill and there weren’t any other campsites around. Was there nowhere on this river where I would have some space to myself? I gave up the hole to them as I wasn’t having much success and went back to my camp.\nThe next morning I was supposed to meet the family in Harrison, on the lake. I was frustrated after the previous day and my plan was to just pack up and leave. I packed up, but made the last minute decision to fish in the morning, and try once again to catch a decent fish in the North Fork Coeur d’Alene. I walked down to the river above a bridge and began wading upstream. I’d tried a lot of different combinations of flies and setups in the previous two days, but because I wasn’t expecting much and was feeling lazy, I had a size 12 or 14 caddis on my line, about the simplest setup imaginable. I pretty quickly caught some small cutts in a shallow section of the river, which encouraged me to wade farther upstream. In a nice looking hole, I made a cast, and a massive fish took the fly. It was more than 15 inches and fought hard. Eventually I landed the fish in my net, and saw that it had another fly with broken line in its mouth. I removed my fly, got the other fly out, and released the fish. I’d actually caught a large Westslope Cutthroat in the North Fork. It was all gravy from there, and I waded upstream and caught more large fish. That turned out to be one of my best days of fishing ever.\nIs the Coeur d’Alene a good trout river? I think so? I didn’t have any success for about the first ten hours I fished (yes, I hooked two cutts in Teepee Creek), but the last four or so were magical. I’m not sure what changed, other than my fly. It is crowded, and I don’t like crowds, but clearly if you can find the right spots with the right fly, there are some fish worth catching. And, after all that, the Idaho Westslope gave me five fish from four states.\n\n\nBig Wood River–Redband Trout\nI had no idea that redband trout are a form of rainbow trout, until I read it on the Idaho Fish and Game website. A lot of people, it seems, are confused by this based on what I’ve read in other fly fishing forums. Here’s what the IFG says, “All rainbow trout native to streams east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon and Washington are called redband trout.” This would be my last fish necessary for to complete the first level of the WNTC, and I had a plan to fish for it on the Big Wood River in Ketchum, Idaho.\nI’m in the Ketchum/Sun Valley area often enough, and it’s one of my favorite mountain towns. There are a lot of outdoor activites, it’s beautiful, especially in the fall, and the Big Wood flows right through town. There is only one problem: I’ve never actually had much success on the Big Wood. A few times I’ve been to Ketchum, my timing has been bad. One year it was still too high to fish and my attempt to wade it nearly resulted in me getting swept downstream into the Snake. Most other times I’ve been to Ketchum I’ve been with other people who don’t want to fish and have only limited patience for watching me fish. I finally got my chance to really fish it in the summer of 2020 when we took advantage of remote work to spend a week at an Airbnb in Hailey. There would be no dining out or hitting the town, but I would have a chance to spend some time on the Big Wood.\nThe unfortunate part of the Big Wood is that it is crowded. That’s to be expected given that it flows through a series of famous mountain towns, and there are fly shops in Ketchum that provide guide services. But still, the first day I tried to fish it in 2020, I didn’t have to wade that far upriver until I ran into another group coming down. I turned around to go back, and there was yet another group behind me. I’ve had more success driving upstream or downstream of town rather than trying to fish in Ketchum itself.\nIn fact, the first redband trout I caught was in Hailey, south of Ketchum and near where I was staying. It was mid-July, and the water was still a little high, but wadeable. It was clear nothing was happening on the surface, so I used both a dry dropper and a tight-line nymph setup to catch fish. Both worked relatively well. Later in the trip I went upstream and managed to catch one or two fish on a dry, though I was using a dropper as well, and that seemed to work better.\nThat experience on the Big Wood was very serviceable. The fishing was steady though not spectacular, I didn’t catch any fish over about 12 inches, nor did I have much action on drys. Still, the Big Wood is a pretty easy river to figure out. Staying in Ketchum or Hailey and spending a few days fishing the Big Wood, and some nearby creeks (e.g., Trail Creek), is a pleasant experience. Just don’t expect to be alone on the water.\n\n\nOther Fish\nWith the Redband from the Big Wood, I had my six fish from four states. Even though I’d previously caught a Yellowstone and Colorado River cutt for the Wyoming slam, I actually submitted two different fish from my slam fish, just for fun. I caught a Colorado River cutthroat from the very top of LaBarge Creek in the Tri-Basin divide. The creek here is very small, but I managed to bring up a few fish. Most people are going to want to fish it farther downstream where the creek is larger, however.\nI also submitted a Yellowstone from South Leigh Creek, outside of Driggs, Idaho. There are a number of small creeks flowing off the western side of the Teton Range, and I picked South Leigh because it was closest to where I was staying. I believe Bitch Creek to be the most famous fishing water of these creeks, and I have backpacked, but not fished, in that drainage. I believe Teton Creek, Badger Creek, North Leigh Creek, and others are also possibilities, but I haven’t fished any of these either. My impression is they are all pretty small and might make for a nice small-water experience, but aren’t going to provide great fishing. Keep in mind that while you’re on the west side of the Tetons and the towns themselves are located in Idaho, almost all the public lands where you can fish are in Wyoming.\n Grand Tetons from Driggs, Idaho area.\n\n\nSubmitted Fish\nHere are the fish I submitted for the “Expert” level of the WNTC and where I caught them.\n\nBonneville Cutt\n\nLogan River, UT\n\nColorado River Cutt\n\nLaBarge Creek, WY\n\nWestslope Cutt\n\nTeepee Creek, ID\n\nYellowstone Cutt\n\nS.

    "title": "Oktoberfest, Munich Germany",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I went to Munich for Oktoberfest in 2022, the first year the event had been held since the pandemic. A number of my friends had previously been and encouraged me to go, with one of them saying something like, “it’s the most fun I’ve ever had.” My overall verdict is not quite as enthusiastic. I thought it was mostly fun, though it wasn’t the life-changing experience I was hoping it would be. A number of circumstances conspired against me, however, and my weak recommendation is that it’s worth doing. That recommendation assumes a positive disposition toward large quantities of beer consumption.\nThe issues I faced were the following. First, I got very sick three days into a five day trip. I don’t think it was COVID as I took a few rapid tests which were all negative, but one of my friends tested positive when he arrived back in the states. I will say that if you are at all concerned about getting COVID, Oktoberfest is not the place for you. The tents are fully enclosed with tens of thousands of people drinking, singing, and yelling, and the bathrooms are crowded and not well ventilated. I was told after leaving that the “Wiesen-flu” is a common sickness around Germany after Oktoberfest ends. I’m guessing that’s what I got, and though I felt well enough to leave my AirBnB after about a day and a half of sickness, it took me weeks to shake the congestion.\nBesides being stuck inside for a few days during my trip, it was rainy and cold the entire time I was in Munich. The outdoor beer gardens at the tents within the Wiesen-ground were closed, as were all the ones within the city. This almost certainly made things more crowded inside the tents and at times, it was difficult to find table space (more on that below). Finally, our AirBnB was not nice, which is a thing that happens sometimes and there isn’t much that can be done about it. Rates for hotels and AirBnBs for Oktoberfest are pricey, and we tried to squeeze five or six people into three bedrooms, without much success.\n\nTravel to and Around Munich\nIt’s easy enough to fly from the states to Munich, and once one arrives, there is a train that goes straight into the city after about a half hour ride. I suppose an Uber or taxi ride is doable, but there’s almost no reason to hire a car as the train is cheap and straightforward. Make sure to purchase a ticket because the police checked on the train and wrote two women a citation–they weren’t messing around.\nOnce in Munich, there is a bus and streetcar system that is sort of navigable to non-German speakers. It took us a few attempts to figure out how to buy tickets as there weren’t any machines at most of the streetcar stations, but we discovered they can be purchased from the drivers. This requires having the right Euro denominations which necessitates stopping at a bank, getting small denomination bills, and making change somewhere. The overall level of difficulty for experienced travelers is not high, but it required some effort. It helps if you’ve had a lot of beer.\nI mostly used the city bike- and scooter-shares, and walked. Annoyingly, the bike-share requires an app that is easiest to setup before you leave and can be found here. Another word of caution: my friend and I tried to use scooters after leaving Oktoberfest one night when the police approached us and warned us that we weren’t allowed to bike or scooter after drinking. They were exceedingly nice about it, but told us that in the eyes of the law, doing so is the equivalent of driving a car drunk (which is, of course, completely absurd). Another night I rode a bike home and no one stopped me, but apparently that was risky.\n\n\nOktoberfest Grounds\nWithin the Oktoberfest grounds, there are rides, food, tents, and gift shops. The food, both at the stands and in the tents, was shockingly good. The tents are mostly chicken and sausage, priced at roughly what they would be at a county fair in the States. Outside the tents at the stands, there was greater variety and the food was perhaps a bit cheaper than in the tents. The rides are carnival style, and my friends and I weren’t interested because of how cold and rainy the weather was. Before I went to Oktoberfest, a friend reminded me that spinny and whirly rides are not the best idea after drinking a lot. Good advice.\n Typical sausage plate.\nThe tents and grounds are more crowded at night, obviously, but surprisingly, everyone seemed to be in a good mood. We saw only one fight our entire Oktoberfest trip, not involving Americans, thank god.\n The grounds at closing time.\n\n\nThe Tents\nThere are something like twelve different main tents, and I probably walked through about eight of them. The vibe inside each varied quite a bit–one tent seemed to have more Germans, while another tent seemed to have no one over the age of about 20. They all have different looks and decorations, though all of them have a band and band leaders, and they all seemed to play the same songs. The music was a mix of pop singalong favorites (Abba, YMCA, Take Me Home Country Roads, Sweet Caroline) and German songs (especially the “Ziggy Zaggy, Ziggy Zaggy, Oi Oi” song). The Europeans also love spontaneous a cappela versions of “Hey Baby”. If I never have to hear that song again it will be too soon. For some reason, “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus, which I hadn’t heard in 15 years, is popular with the bands and the patrons. Brush up on the words before you fly to Germany. The music, especially the pop music, gets kind of old after awhile as it’s pitched at the Boomer/Gen-X karoake demographic. I’m sure others disagree, but the beer mostly tastes the same though across tents. Consuming beer by the liter is not designed for discerning palates.\nBeer service.\nHow wild were things inside the tents? It kind of depended on the tent, but moderately wild, especially at night. After about 7 p.m. everyone has had a lot to drink so most people are drinking and talking. In general, everyone is pretty well behaved and security is present but there is not as much oversight as at an American club. I saw one person throwing up (everywhere) and security eventually saw him and gently escorted him out. It was very nice! I also saw a handful of people doing hard drugs without exactly being surreptitious about it. I didn’t see any fights except the one I previously mentioned outside a tent which occurred at about two in the afternoon. In some of the tents, especially at night, people stand on the benches rather than sit, but occasionally a bench goes over and people go everywhere. It’s important to maintain your balance, and if you cause the bench to tip over you might get a talking-to by other partyers.\n A tent I visited (who knows which one). Band at left.\n\n\nMaking Reservations\nYes, it would be helpful, but reservations are not strictly necessary and it isn’t that easy for non-German speakers to make reservations. The ability to make reservations seems to depend on the tent, the day, and the time. Our experience was that reservations were not needed in any tent during the day as there was plenty of space open, especially during weekdays. At night, things were more crowded, and reservations were required in some of the tents we visited. In others, the servers were willing to squeeze you in if there was room at a table, though in most of the tents you could also squeeze into the walkways between tables. This is a bit claustrophobic and uncomfortable, and you have to walk to the end of the aisles to order more beer.\nThe first tent we visited was on a Thursday afternoon and wasn’t very crowded. We were able to sit down and order food and beer without a problem. At about 4 p.m., the server kicked us out so they could begin preparing for the evening shift, for which all tables were reserved. Unfortunately, I can’t remember the names of any of the tents as they are long German words, the beer in different tents was virtually indistinguishable and, well, I was drinking.\n Hacker-Pschorr Tent, though I have no memory of visiting. Everyone is standing on benches rather than sitting.\nAfter we left the first tent, we walked into another tent, couldn’t find any space, walked into a third tent, and decided we needed to be more aggressive about making space for ourselves. My group split up, and myself and two of my friends were able to make space in a walkway rather than at a table. This made it a little tricky to get beer, though with a little persistence we were able to do so. I think the key thing for Americans to remember is that personal space and beer service are not as regimented as in the U.S. If you see a plausible place to stand, occupy that space until someone makes you move. If you see a server walking by with beer, wave them down. It’s far more of a free-for-all as compared to American restaurants or bars.\nThe next night, Friday, was much more crowded, but we were able to get a table in a tent in the early afternoon. This particular tent did not make us leave and we held that table until closing (which is early, about 10 p.m.) The server did try to squeeze other people in, and if your party isn’t large enough, other people are going to be sat at your table. This isn’t bad as it gives you a chance to talk to others and meet people from different parts of the world.\nThe reality is, even if you want to make a reservation. it’s likely going to be difficult. Figuring out the websites prior to leaving the States seemed impossible. Those sites that I could figure out required significant deposits for both beer and food (something like $150 a person, with a minimum on the number of people) that I wasn’t willing to shell out before getting to Germany. The reservation sites also require you to specify a time. I was skeptical I would be able to wrangle my eight friends to get to a tent at a particular time in the early evening, which also made me hesitant to schedule a reservation.\nIn sum, though I think reservations would have helped, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, it wasn’t easy to make them and we were able to survive without them. It’s important to get to a tent before things get crowded in the early evening. If the waiters clear the table at 4 p.m., I recommend moving quickly to another tent to get a table for the evening. If you’ve got a table at around 5, don’t leave it unless you’re ready to go home. This website, which I found on Reddit, sends out emails for reservations via email though as I’ve said, we never used it. Bring Euros in cash, as the tents are strictly a cash operation. Munich in general seemed more cash-based than most other European countries I’ve visited.\n\n\nWould I Go Back?\nI think the answer is yes, especially if I had friends who were enthusiastic. In retrospect, I had a lot of bad luck that diminished my fun. Getting sick halfway through the trip meant I didn’t actually get all that much time at Oktoberfest. The weather and lodging situation definitely didn’t help things either.\nIf going during the official Oktoberfest isn’t an option, one could have a similar type of experience just by going to the beer halls in downtown Munich. Many of the breweries have their own halls near Marienplatz and it’s easy to walk between them. In fact, we did that our first night in Germany and it may have been my favorite overall experience. The beer is the same as in the tents, the food is probably better, and there are Bavarian bands and lots of other people hanging out. (The beer halls in Munich are, shall we say, famous). It also helped that I wasn’t sick at that point in the trip.\n Marienplatz on a rainy night.\nOne final thing: wear lederhosen or a dirndl at Oktoberfest. I know it sounds silly, and I was initially opposed, but almost everyone wears it, and it makes the experience more fun and festive. I read articles online that said not to buy cheap or knock-off clothes because the Germans will be annoyed, but I really doubt anyone would notice. I bought lederhosen from this site which I really liked, but my friends rented from this place, which was also a good option. Whether you buy or rent depends on your willingness to use lederhosen for future Oktoberfests in the States, or as a Halloween costume. I am now obligated to attend American Oktoberfests in my lederhosen for the rest of my life."

    "text": "Even after completing the O, I’m still struggling to process the hike. Every influencer website I’ve seen has a title like, “OMG, 15 reasons why you must hike the O!” This is not going to be one of those posts. The O trek has some real problems, and I’m still not sure I actually enjoyed it. Some of these were the result of bad luck (the weather), but some of the issues I encountered are systematic, and are the same issues encountered by everyone who undertakes it. I asked another hiker on the trek, who was older and more philosophical than me, whether he would recommend the hike to others. He said he’d thought about the question a lot because he had friends back in the States who were backpackers and would want to know how it was. His response was something like, “I’ll tell them what my experience was, avoid trying to frame it either way, and let them decide for themselves.” I think that’s a good answer, so here goes.\n\nThe Good: Scenery, Easy Hike, Safe\nThe scenery, from what I could see, is incredible. The trail is all killer, no filler, with day after day of views. There are no long approaches through trees, no trudging for a day to get to the good stuff, no boring terrain. Every day is spectacular. I’d done a lot of research before the trip and was honestly worried I’d be underwhelmed by the views; I wasn’t. The diversity of the views is amazing too, as the hike traverses forests, deserts, alpine areas, glaciers, river valleys, and cliffs. Many of the mountain scenes don’t even look real, appearing more like computer generated special effects for a movie. At times, I thought the good stuff would be over; it never was. This is one of the world’s most famous hikes for a reason, and the views didn’t disappoint.\nIt’s a good option for people who want to ease into longer, multi-day hikes. It’s in a foreign country with a different language, which makes things a little trickier, but there are a lot of resources for completing it, and the physical aspect is not that demanding. There is plenty of support if things go wrong, there are no animals to worry about, no chance of losing the trail, and lots of people to keep one company. The scenery/difficulty tradeoff is really high, meaning that hikers really get a lot of bang for their walking miles. The refugio system also provides food and shelter, which means substantially less weight for people who don’t want to carry much.\n\n\nThe Bad: Weather, Crowds, Cost\nThe list is long, but each of these things are arguably less important than the actual hike itself. The cost is high, the logistics are annoying, the trail itself is a complete disaster, it’s crowded, and the camping/refugio/park bureaucracy is hard to deal with.\nThe weather deserves a special mention here as it nearly ruined our trip, but this isn’t constant across hikers like the other things I mentioned. In other words, a hiker could luck out, get great weather and see everything, or one could have rain every day, which makes the experience much worse.\nThe biggest problem with the rain is that it obscured many of our views. We saw almost nothing of the Rio Paine River valley, the area around Dickson, or the Frances-Britanico canyon. Of our seven days on the trail, views on two of them were completely blocked by rain, two more days had mostly obscured views for much of the day, and only three days had relatively good views. It was very frustrating to spend days traveling to the park, months planning, and thousands of dollars to arrive and see only the bottom third of the mountain. This is perhaps my biggest hesitation in recommending the trip to others. Of course, one cannot plan for the weather, and this was just uncommonly bad luck, but the bad weather in Patagonia certainly weighs negatively on the scale of whether to hike the O.\n\n\nThe Ugly: The refugios\nThe refugios and the entire system surrounding them is a complete and utter disaster. Two private companies, Vertice and Fantastico Sur (also called Las Torres), manage all the refugios in the park. The CEOs of both should be jailed for crimes against humanity. There are clearly too many people at each refugio so everything was crowded. The food was disgusting, the costs exorbitant, and the outward contempt for hikers displayed by both the companies and their staff, from start to finish, is overwhelming. The Chilean government should burn the entire refugio system down (metaphorically) and start over.\n\n\nTopics\n\nLogistics of travel to and from the park\nOverview of our hike, including mileage, times, and descriptions\nProblems with the O\nThe Refugio System\nImpressions of Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales\nMt.

The trip was canceled due to bad weather."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike most hikers, we planned to do the hike in six days. We didn’t meet a single other person who had this schedule, so I’ll detail the normal schedule, then what we did. The Caltopo mileage map of our hike is here: O in Six Nights. Note that all information described here reflects my experience in February 2023, but may change–all information should be independently verified.\nMost hikers completing the O move from refugio to refugio on the back side. There are more choices on the front side (the part that overlaps with the W), so there things are a little bit more flexible. For our purposes, moving counter-clockwise with the direction of the hike, the back side consists of the refugios of Seron, Dickson, and Los Perros, while the front side (also the W side), consists of Grey, Paine Grande, Frances, and Cuernos. The refugios are a cluster of buildings consisting of a lobby/eating area, a cooking area, a hostel-style dormitory, a minimarket with varying quantity and quality of food, and a designated camping area. All hikers must camp or stay at the refugios–unlike in the U.S., there is no camping where you choose.\nRefugios (moving counter-clockwise)\n\nCentro (park entrance, mile 0)\nSeron (first refugio from the park entrance, mile 8.27 from Centro excluding hike up to Mirador Base Las Torres)\nDickson (all hikers completing the O must have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros; most have reservations at both, mile 19.29 from Centro)\nLos Perros (all hikers must leave Los Perros by 7am to start over the pass, mile 26.62 from Centro)\nGrey (mile 35.65 from Centro)\nPaine Grande (mile 42.18 from Centro)\nFrances (mile 55.7 from Centro, including hike to Frances, bag drop, up to miradores, back to Frances)\nCuernos (Frances and Cuernos are close to each other and interchangeable for the last night’s stay, mile 57.9 from Centro)\n\nCONAF, the Chilean national forest bureaucracy, manages the park. The refugio system is meant to protect the park, but also manage the visitors. In particular, the Los Perros refugio is essentially used as a staging area for hikers to get over the pass. Thus, the main requirement of the refugio system is that hikers spend the night at Los Perros so they can begin trekking over the pass from Los Perros at 7am. The CONAF rangers close the trail after 7am as the pass is much safer and less windy early in the day, apparently. (I believe this requirement is in place all summer as there were signs along the trail informing hikers of the 7am start time, but I’ve also read in other places that when the weather is better the 7am cutoff does not exist.)\nFrom this requirement, everything flows backwards. Most visitors hike from Centro to Seron, Seron to Dickson, and Dickson to Los Perros so they can be in position to begin the hike over the pass at 7 am. A few miles after Seron, there is a ranger station where the ranger on duty checks reservations to ensure that hikers have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros. If a hiker does not, they will not let them proceed to the back side of the O. Note, however, that there was no requirement you have reservations at both Dickson and Los Perros (as of February 2023). Technically, it seems like one could camp at Dickson then make it to Los Perros before 7am to cross the pass. That doesn’t make sense though, and it’s much easier to skip Dickson and hike directly from Seron to Los Perros, which seemed to be allowed by the park system, though not by the reservation system (more details on that in the discussion of the refugio section). Also important to note is that you must make Dickson by 2pm to continue to Los Perros. There is a ranger station at Dickson and they close the trail at 2.\nAfter Los Perros, visitors hike from refugios Los Perros to Grey, Grey to Paine Grande, Paine Grande to either Frances or Cuernos (they are within two miles of each other), then out back to Centro, taking a total of seven nights. We took six nights by hiking from Seron to Los Perros, skipping Dickson. Our logic was that the hike from Dickson to Los Perros is listed by most sources as only five miles, though according to Caltopo, it’s closer to 7.5. When we told other hikers we had done this, many of them didn’t even realize it’s allowed. Once you’re over the pass, after Los Perros, anything goes. One could conceivably hike from Grey to Frances/Cuernos without too much trouble, skipping Paine Grande, then out to Centro.\nI think the minimum number of nights to complete the trek would be as follows: stay at Centro and hike to Las Torres, Centro to Seron, Seron to Los Perros, Los Perros to Paine Grande, Paine Grande to Centro. This would be only four nights, including a night at Centro to complete Base Las Torres, and would require some super human effort as the mileage doesn’t tell the whole story, so I DO NOT recommend it, but for extremely fit hikers, it seems doable. The hike from Grey to Paine Grande is short and easy, as is the hike from Paine Grande to either Frances or Cuernos. The hike from either of those two back to Centro is not particularly short (about 10 miles), but is relatively easy.\nThe problem is, the hike from Seron to Los Perros is not easy, nor is the hike from Los Perros to Grey, despite relatively short mileage. We skipped Dickson because it didn’t make sense to us to have a day that was only seven miles (Dickson to Los Perros), but this hike turned out to be much tougher than we expected because of the rain, the mud, and the structure of the trail. Again, most hikers will want to complete the hike in the normal seven nights. Very fit hikers can complete the trek in six nights, while attempting it in any fewer nights should be left to those who can easily do 20+ mile days (again, the mileage on the O doesn’t tell the whole story, for reasons described below).\n\nHiking Days\nSummary of our hiking days, with mileage taken from Caltopo, not from any official trail maps or online publications. Distances given on the infrequent signs on the trail are obviously wrong, so you should ignore them. Time is hours to complete, excluding breaks, though this measure is imperfect and will vary based on conditions.\n\nDay 1: Arrive at park, camp at Centro, hike Base Las Torres and back. 11.78 miles, 3467 ft. total elevation gain, 5.5 hours.\nWe took a bus that left Puerto Natales at 6:45am and arrived at the park about two hours later, around 8:45. After accomplishing the rigmorole with entering the park and catching the shuttle bus, we walked over to the Centro campsite as we wanted to drop our packs there, and perhaps even reserve our site. It was only about 9:30 am, but they let us check in and instructed us to find a spot without a tent. Unlike U.S. park campsites, there are no designated spots, just an area where you can setup anywhere. We put up our tent to claim our spot and started hiking from there up to Base Las Torres.\nMany hikers save the Base Las Torres hike for the end, and hike only to Seron the first day. I prefer our method because it seemed to shorten the trip a little, and we didn’t have to fight the crowds at the end of the hike after we were tired. In terms of hiking difficulty, the stats suggest this is the second most difficult day, though you’re not carrying a backpack. This is the most popular day hike in the park because it basically leaves from the Welcome Center. The trail is crowded with day hikers and we struggled to fight through a lot of slow hikers, many of whom refused to give way to faster hikers.\n Looking up Windy Pass.\nFrom the Welcome Center the trail meanders down the park road until it reaches the Hotel. From there, it’s basically flat until it begins climbing steeply after a bridge. The trail gains a lot of elevation very quickly until reaching Paso del Viento, which provides nice views up the valley and back across the plain. From here, the trail goes downhill to the Chileno refugio, then flattens out a bit, then climbs again steeply. After climbing, the last push to the Las Torres bowl begins, and eventually hikers come out of the trees and begin a steep rocky ascent up a drainage, then cut across the face of the slope until emerging in the bowl at Lago Torres. It’s this last section where the hiking conga-line gets really bad as the trail is steep, narrow, and slow.\n Crowds heading up the last push toward Base Las Torres.\nIt’s important to begin this hike as early as possible as the weather seems to deteriorate in the afternoon. Even though we took the 6:45am bus, we weren’t able to start hiking until about 10am after taking the shuttle bus, getting the campsite, setting up our tent, etc. By the time we were nearly down, about 3pm, it had started raining near the towers. It’s also important to note that the rangers close the trail to the towers at Chileno after 2pm, and at 4pm, they apparently make everyone start descending.\n\n\nDay 2: Centro to Seron. 8.27 miles, 1132 ft. total elevation gain, 3 hours.\nThis is one of the easier hikes on the Circuit. From Centro, the trail steeply climbs some hilly terrain and is a bit up and down for a few miles, eventually dropping into the Rio Paine Grande river basin. It’s obvious when this occurs and if you look closely down into the basin you can see the refugio across a flat meadow that’s a quick hike. The views to the left of the mountains are good (from what I could see), and once you reach the ridge looking down into the valley you get a preview of the next day’s hike. We weren’t able to see all that much as storms rolled in intermittently throughout the day. At the time, the weather was annoying, though this was only a preview of what was to come.\n\n\nDay 3: Seron to Los Perros. 18.35 miles, 3197 ft. total elevation gain, 8 hours.\nAfter the Seron refugio, the trail climbs into some hills bordering the river, which will be on the right. The trail is a bit up and down here, though mostly up and sometimes quite steeply. Until you are definitively headed west rather than north (for about 2.5 miles), you have not turned the corner and will not start heading down. In this area, there is also a sign that hikers should not proceed without a reservation at either Dickson or Los Perros. Lago Paine will be on the right, and the views from the walk along the top of this hill, looking down at the lake and up the Rio Paine Valley are fantastic. From the top, it’s a pretty easy, though windy, hike across the face of the mountains. The trail drops down into the trees and the ranger check station, to ensure hikers have reservations at either Dickson or Los Perros, is located here. This is probably five or six miles from Seron.\nThe ranger described the subsequent five or six miles as flat, but it’s more like gently rolling. Still, the hiking is easy and the views get better and better as one approaches Dickson. For us, these last five or six miles to Dickson were the worst on the entire trip because it was absolutely pouring rain and we couldn’t see more than two hundred feet off the valley floor. But, I think the views would have been really good. There is a sign somewhere near the wetland that says Dickson is something like 2 km, but it felt more like 4. The trail climbs a large hill, and upon summitting, you can see Dickson down below. It looks like the trail nearly falls off a cliff, but it’s a steep, short hike down.\n This was typical of our views on the way to Dickson because of the rain.\nMost hikers will stop here and spend the night, and we did the approximately 11.5 mile hike to Dickson in a quick four hours, but we were really moving because of the rain. Despite the elevation gain at the beginning, this is a pretty easy hike. The difficulty we had was from Dickson to Los Perros. The trail immediately begins climbing after Dickson and doesn’t stop until Seron. It was complete slop at this point, both from the rain and the previous group of hikers who left from Dickson in the morning. Despite our research and maps telling us this hike is only about five miles, Caltopo suggests it’s more like seven. It took us another four hours to go seven miles, even after we’d just gone more than 11 miles in four hours.\nWe stopped at Dickson for about an hour to try and dry out, and this was really the low point of the trip for me. I was soaking wet, I knew I had another five or more miles ahead of me, it was still pouring rain and all the views were obscured. Luckily, while we tried to warm up at Dickson, the rain broke just enough so that we were mostly hiking through showers and spritzes the rest of the day, rather than the outright downpour that occurred on the walk to Dickson. We could even see some mountain peaks once we gained elevation after Dickson, and I imagine if it was clear, the scenery would be incredible, reminiscent of the Alps.\n The clouds lifted just enough to give us views like this on the trail between Dickson and Los Perros.\nAfter the initial climb out of Dickson, the trail flattens out a bit, then turns the corner on the drainage and begins another steep climb. The mud here was challenging. A sign indicates the Los Perros refugio was only 2km, but there is no way this is accurate. The trail keeps climbing and everytime you think you’re going to top out and arrive, the trail finds more elevation. Eventually, you can see the side of a bowl in front of you, and the trail climbs through the trees into the bowl, which is Laguna Los Perros and Glacier Los Perros. The view of the lake and glacier is incredible, but it was late in the day for us, the wind was howling, we were soaking wet, and it was still drizzling, so we kept walking. I have no photos of the lake or the glacier, which is unfortunate, but I was in absolutely no mood at the time to stop and get my camera out of my pack. The trail goes up a little more from here, then descends into a small creek drainage, and the refugio is on the left amongst some trees.\nThe hike was hard in terms of miles and distance, but very doable for hikers with above average fitness, though the mud does not discriminate. On a nice day, I think it would be very pleasant and relatively straighforward, and of course, that was our thought when we planned the trip and decided to skip Dickson. While the scenery around Dickson looked nice, in my opinion the hikes from Seron to Dickson, and then from Dickson to Los Perros, are too easy to justify two separate days. That assumes, of course, that you aren’t hiking in the rain and the mud for nearly eight hours. In retrospect, I’m still glad we didn’t spend two days completing this section of the hike, but it was pretty miserable given the weather.\n\n\nDay 3: Los Perros to Grey. 9.03 miles, 2816 ft. total elevation gain, 7.5 hours.\nThe wind absolutely howled all night (when didn’t it?) at Los Perros, and we could hear rain showers smacking our tent. I was legitimately nervous about how the hike over the pass would go. It turned out that I was right to be nervous, as I later learned that the day before, when we were hiking in the rain near Dickson, hikers were crossing the pass in a blinding snow storm. Word around the camp the previous day at Seron was that a big storm was coming in, and I asked one of the workers at the refugio to check the weather and if he thought we’d be able to get over the pass. He told us that the weather looked bad, and it would be a rough hike, both of which he was correct about. He also said that the rangers coordinate with the refugios about weather over the pass, and that it is possible they would close the pass. In that case, hikers would be held at each refugio down the line, though it must take awfully bad weather for the rangers to close the pass.\nLuckily for us, despite the bad weather overnight, things cleared for our pass day. It really wasn’t all that cold either. When you stop at Los Perros, you are required to check-in at the ranger station. They warn you about the pass, advise you to leave Los Perros as soon as is feasible, around 6:30am when it begins to get light (in late February), and to follow other groups. The trail itself is also well-marked with orange paint, poles, and blazes, but in a blizzard it might be easy to lose your way (as I later learned).\nThe trail to the top of the pass is steep, but relatively short. It’s mostly through small trees at the start, which provides some protection from the wind, but annoyingly, it sometimes loses elevation for no good reason. Once the trail emerges out of the trees, it’s pretty much straight up some rocky slopes with a few small creek crossings. The views are nearly indescribable. There is a large glacier on hiker’s right that is at and above your elevation, views down canyon to the peaks below, and craggy mountain peaks above and to the left. This area is really where some switchbacks would be useful as the trail ascends nearly straight up the rocks to small flat areas, then heads up again.\n From near the top of Paso John Garner looking back to Lago Los Perros.\nThe hike to the pass is only a little more than two miles, and it took us less than three hours total. The initial descent from the pass descends the rocky saddle and you can’t see much of Grey Glacier until it gets steeper. It’s also (of course) very windy. After the initial descent, the trail cuts to the left and Grey glacier comes closer into view. It’s hard to describe the view of the mountains, the glacier, which is much farther below you, and how it appears up and down valley. Unfortunately, the steepness and muddiness of the trail made for a pretty miserable descent, as it was almost impossible not to slip and fall here. The going was really slow and eventually hikers arrive at Camp Paso, with another ranger check-in. The ranger asked me how we were doing, and said there were two meters of snow on the pass the day before, which I found just incredible as there was almost no snow when we ascended. When I asked what happened to all the snow, he shrugged and said, “se va,” it goes. As an aside, I found that with a little bit of Spanish, all the rangers loved chatting hikers up and asking if they were enjoying themselves.\n Once over the pass, the views of Grey Glacier are amazing.\nI also made the mistake of asking the ranger how far it was to Grey refugio. I thought it was about 2.5 more miles, and he said it was 10.5 km, or about 6.5 miles. This simply seemed impossible as we’d spent nearly six hours hiking from Los Perros. How had we only gone three miles or so, especially after reaching the top of the pass in a such a short time? The descent from the pass was that bad. Once you arrive at the ranger station, the difficult descent is mostly done, though the trail here is really up and down and still somewhat muddy. The famous suspension bridges are in this area, and I’m glad we didn’t have to do them in strong winds. I couldn’t enjoy them as much as I wanted because I was ready to be done with the hike.\n Steep and muddy all the way down.\nWe arrived at Grey around 3pm, which means we hiked for about eight hours and fifteen minutes, covering only nine miles. This was the first day I truly felt tired after the hike, and I thought that despite the short distance, it was by far the most difficult day. I spoke to other hikers at the refugio, and they confirmed that the hike was more difficult than they had imagined. And, surprisingly, it wasn’t the hike up to the pass, but down from the pass that was hard. In terms of day difficulties, this ranked first, with the previous day, more than 18 miles from Seron to Los Perros, a distant second. It was just impossible to move with any kind of urgency descending from the pass in the mud, then hiking another six miles or so constantly going up and down.\nA few days later, I spoke to another hiker who had climbed the pass the day before us. I still found the ranger’s statement about there being two meters of snow on the pass unbelievable, but my hiker friend said he summitted the pass in a blizzard. All the warnings the rangers had given us at Seron actually applied to him as he said he couldn’t see a thing, it was snowing hard, and the wind was sideways. Part of his thumb was still numb from the experience. This strikes me as unusual, but given the rain and cold we had down low, it isn’t hard for me to imagine how bad the pass could have been. He also said a ranger was ascending the other side of the pass as he was coming down, checking on people, making sure they were okay, and helping guide them down. I don’t think the CONAF rangers play fast and loose with people’s safety on the pass, and I do think they check conditions regularly, but it also seems like they want to keep the line moving. For the vast majority of hikers, this will never be an issue, but bad luck does strike, and those hikers were in a difficult situation.\n\n\nDay 4: Grey to Paine Grande. 6.53 miles, 1221 ft. total elevation gain, 3 hours.\nAn easy day, and boy did we need it after the previous two. This was our second day of good weather and the hiking was crisp. After the steep descent from the pass, the trail more slowly descends toward the lake and glacier, before and after Greys. The views are really spectacular, and you get different perspectives of the glacier by starting way above it, then closer to it, then moving past it and looking back on it. This day was so clear, we could see more of the mountains on the other side of Lago Grey. This was perhaps my favorite day of the hike.\nFrom Grey, the trail is mostly flat (at least relatively to the previous day) until it climbs steeply but shortly up to a small little drainage on the side of a cliff. There is some minor exposure here, as there was on the previous day. I don’t like exposure at all, but this was really minimal, though not nothing. I think for most people, the suspension bridges will be a little scarier than the exposure. It’s repetitive to talk about the views again, so I’ll just say they were indescribable, with the lake, the mountains, and the glacier in the distance. Just when you’re cursing the trail, the weather, the government of Chile, other hikers, the people you’re with, the refugios, and basically anything else you can think of, the O delivers a day like this.\n What a view, between Grey and Paine Grande.\nEventually the trail descends steeply down a canyon and O hikers meet more and more W hikers coming up from Paine Grande. At the end of the canyon, on Lago Pehoe, is the Paine Grande refugio. Paine Grande, the peak, along with the Cuernos, tower over the refugio. Unfortunately, the refugio is located at the exact base of the canyon for maximum wind exposure, though that’s the least of this refugio’s problems. I’m glad we had some time here because we finished hiking early and the views up to the peaks are spectacular, as are the views looking across the lake.\n\n\nDay 5: Paine Grande to Frances, including Mirador Britanico. 13.52 miles, 3512 ft. total elevation gain. We completed only about eight miles of this, in about 3 hours. The time is difficult to determine because we waited at various points to see if the weather would clear.\nWe’d had two days of nice weather so it was inevitable our luck would run out. While we started the day from Grey to Paine Grande in bright sunshine, by that night it had clouded up completely and it was clear another storm was moving in. It started raining that night quite hard, and we awoke in the morning to intermittent, but heavy showers. The forecast as posted in the refugio suggested it would clear up, but unfortunately it never did.\n The Paine Grande refugio has its issues, but the view can’t be beat.\nOur original plan was to hike from Paine Grande to Italiano, which is not a proper refugio but two buildings with some shelter. I don’t think there is much else there, but I’m not entirely sure about that. From there, the trail splits, with one direction of it going up into the canyon to provide views of the Frances glacier and the Cuernos, and the other going to Frances refugio. Shortly after Frances, about two more miles, is Cuernos refugio. Our original plan was to drop our packs at Italiano, hike up to the overlooks, then back down, grab our packs and continue the mile or so to Frances. We’d originally wanted to camp at Cuernos as it was closer to our exit the next day, but it was fully booked so we were stuck at Frances, in one of the “fancy” canvas tents.\nThe hike from Paine Grande to Italiano is easy. Immediately out of Paine Grande refugio, there is a short and easy climb, then it is mostly small, rolling terrain, passing by a small lake and descending slightly toward Italiano. These four and a half miles or so took us only about two hours, though we left later in the morning because we were trying to wait out the weather. That didn’t work, and we hiked a lot of this in rain, though it wasn’t as bad as the rain to Dickson.\nEven before you arrive at Italiano, you can see up-valley enough to get glimpses of Frances glacier. Unfortunately, it was raining harder on the mountains and glacier, and they were totally socked-in. We decided to continue hiking to Frances refugio, drop our packs, shelter in the tent, and hopefully wait the storm out, before back-tracking to Italiano to hike up to the miradores, hopefully in better weather. It’s an initial uphill from Italiano to Frances, then a downhill, but the distance is short. Besides, given the weather, there seemed to be no point to going up to the miradores. Of course, when we arrived at Frances, about 12:30pm, the person working there told us we couldn’t check in until 2:30. Check-in times had not been enforced at all in the previous refugios, but now that we desperately wanted a place to shelter and dry-off, we couldn’t. He very clearly told us we couldn’t check-in until 2:30, though he actually opened the window and began allowing check-ins about 1:30, so were able to claim our canvas, $200 a night tent.\nAt about 2pm, we decided to hike back to Italiano and see if we could get some views. It was clear at this point that the weather was not going to clear, and I feared it was pointless trying to go up the canyon to Frances and Britanico. Indeed, we got back to Italiano, we waited out a heavy rainstorm, and began hiking up. According to a sign posted at Italiano, the rangers close the trail up Miradores Frances and Britanico at 3pm, and we started hiking at 2:30. We just couldn’t wait any longer, and it increasingly appeared futile. We went maybe a mile, saw the very bottom of the glacier, and hiked down. We also couldn’t see anything up-canyon or the Cuernos and it was raining steadily. What a disappointment.\n Our best view of Frances glacier.\nIt absolutely poured all night long, and though I was initially upset that we paid for the fancy tent during the booking process, it was nice to keep all of our stuff, and ourselves, dry. I’m not sure it was $200 nice, but I can’t complain about the heavy canvas and lots of storage space inside the tent. It also got noticeably colder with the passage of the front, and it was much easier to pack up in the morning inside the canvas tent rather than wrestling with our bags under our backpacking tent’s rainfly.\n\n\nDay 7: Frances to Centro. 10.15 miles, 1731 ft. total elevation gain.\nThe next day we had to hike out from Frances. We knew it was about 10 miles, but we were uncertain about mud and trail conditions, especially because it had rained hard all night and we were traumatized from the mud on the previous days. As a result, we left very early, about 7:30am, to make a bus at 3pm. We’d heard different rumors about the shuttle schedule from the Welcome Center back to the entrance station at Laguna Amarga, with one hiker telling us that it came every 20 minutes, while other hikers suggested it was far less frequent. Because we didn’t know the shuttle schedule, we were worried that if we missed a shuttle at say, 2pm, there might not be another shuttle until 2:30, which would mean arriving at 2:45 at the earliest, potentially cutting it close (we later learned the shuttle schedule, as explained here).\nIt turns out we didn’t need any extra motivation to haul ass out of Frances. The pouring rain, the cold, and the wind meant we were more than ready to be done with the hike. I was willing to run back to Centro if I had to, in order to make the bus. The hike itself was actually quite easy. The rain eased up enough that we could see some small portion of the peaks near the Cuernos, and on the southeast side of the park.\nFrom Frances the trail drops steeply to lake level where there is a short beach walk, then climbs a little to Cuernos refugio. After the refugio, it goes over a small ridge and begins an up-and-down trek through the hills at the base of the mountains. It wasn’t particularly muddy, but there were a lot of small creeks running down the trail. Based on the trail structure, I think these creeks are more or less permanent features of the trail, and like most days, it was really hard to keep your boots dry. One piece of advice I’d offer for other hikers is to bring lots of extra pairs of socks and good waterproof boots.\nOnce we turned the corner on Lago Nordenskjold, the hiking was easy, and I knew we were close when we began running into W hikers coming the other direction from Centro. I was surprisingly tired by the time we got back to the hotel area and trail junction with the Mirador Las Torres trail. The distance covered wasn’t that much, and it was fairly easy hiking, so I think my legs were worn out from the start of the hike when I was almost literally running back to Centro to ensure we made the bus and beat the rain. We covered some of the same ground we did on that first day near the end of the hike, though there were far fewer people going up to the Towers. Even though the rain stopped and the clouds lifted for much of this hike, the rain moved in again just as we returned to the Welcome Center and it began pouring. Our hike was over, and on this day we barely even got wet!\nWe arrived at the Welcome Center about 12:30, and had to wait until 2pm for the shuttle, then sat on the bus from 2:30pm to 3, until it left for Puerto Natales.\n\n\n\nAdditional Info\nIn my opinion, guides are not at all necessary unless you really, really want to be in a tour group with others. It’s impossible to lose the trail, with maybe the exception of going over the pass in really bad weather. It’s unlikely weather will be that bad, but hikers basically all go over together so by paying attention and watching others there shouldn’t be any issues.\nTrail signs are not accurate and should be ignored.\nThere were plenty of mosquitoes on the backside. They weren’t a problem for us because it was rainy and windy the entire time, but in good weather they could be an issue.\nWe tried to avoid drinking the water without filtering or boiling first. Everyone kept saying it was fine, but sorry, I just didn’t want to take the chance. Most of the tap water at the refugios appeared to just be water straight from the creeks with varying degrees of clarity.\nAs the hike description makes clear, it isn’t necessary to carry that much water because there is water on the trail everywhere.\nBring your own soap and toilet paper.\nIt is helpful to have all your reservations, bus tickets, and confirmation emails printed out. As noted, these were mostly not checked at the refugios, but the rangers checked them and I wouldn’t trust the refugio system to have an accurate accounting of your food and tent reservations on hand.\nAll the refugios take credit cards though it’s useful to have cash on hand for the shuttle bus and if the credit card machines go down, which happened a few times.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "title": "The Refugio System",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Oh boy, where to even start? I take no joy in reporting that the refugio system on the O is beyond screwed up, though I’m baffled by some of the other comments I’ve seen online. A search of Reddit threads shows people saying that they believe the refugios have lots of supplies, the people are friendly, the services useful, and the food excellent. I have no idea in what year or which universe these people visited the refugios, because my experience was uniformly terrible in myriad ways, both large and small.\nThe most pressing problem is that the refugios are much, much too small. I have read, and had people tell me on the hike, that the refugios on the back side are now handling 70 people a day. Unfortunately, the refugios are constructed to handle maybe 20 people a day. To give some sense of the problem, at both Seron and Los Perros, there are exactly four bathroom stalls, total. There are approximately 40 to 50 men staying at Seron and Los Perros for anywhere between 8 and 16 hours, and there are exactly two or three toilets to use (two at Seron, three at Los Perros for men). At both places, the days we were there, the toilets became clogged and stopped working. Without getting too graphic, the morning we left Los Perros, people were going to the bathroom in a near-overflowing toilet that wouldn’t flush. There was virtually no soap at any of the refugio bathrooms, and toilet paper was hit-and-miss. The bathrooms, especially at Seron and Los Perros, make the Oktoberfest tent bathrooms look like Donald Trump’s golden toilet.\nThere were two showers at Seron, something like three at Los Perros, and only a few more at Grey. The front-side refugios are bigger, because they also handle hikers from the W, but are still not big enough. It wasn’t just the shower and bathroom facilities. All hikers must cook in a designated room or tent, and these are much too small at all refugios, except for maybe Frances, which splits traffic with Cuernos and has multiple small cooking rooms. There are lines for everything: check-in, toilets, sinks, cooking space, seating, dish washing, etc. The food was absolute garbage, and the food and accommodations were obscenely overpriced, though buying food and beer from the minimarkets wasn’t that bad.\nLook, I recognize this is a hike and I don’t expect five star accommodations. I’m most familiar with wilderness camping using nothing but my own supplies, but the O forces everyone into these small spaces. I’m sure the refugios are hard to resupply, and they are handling too many people in an effort to meet public demand. But still, it would be nice if it wasn’t blindingly obvious that every single person associated with the system has stopped caring. Why bother? Permits for every single day are sold out and there is no shortage of people wanting to do the O hike. It’s really a shame.\nI organize this section by refugios this will be how most people encounter the refugios on the hike and certain themes will emerge. I count Centro as a refugio, and note that we skipped Dickson and Chileno, and chose Frances rather than Cuernos because Cuernos was sold out.\n\nPreliminaries\nEveryone must stay at a refugio. There are a few basic options as to your accommodations, with some variation by refugio. Hikers can stay inside a dorm style building with a bed, outside in a refugio owned tent, outside in a fancier, larger canvas tent, or outside using their own gear. The fancier canvas tents are available at Chileno and Frances for sure, but not any other refugios as far as I’m aware.\nAt each refugio, there is a designated area to setup your own tent if that’s what you’re doing, as we did. The refugio owned tents have slightly better locations on the grounds in terms of wind-shelter many of them are located on wooden platforms, and they are slightly larger dome-style tents as compared to a typical backpacking tent. For those using their own gear, wooden platforms are mostly not available, though at some refugios (e.g., Seron), you might get lucky.\nAll refugios have a small market with some basic things like alcohol, candy bars, snacks, etc. though again, the quantity of items varies quite dramatically by refugio. Paine Grande had a full bar (good luck getting a seat or service), but that was the exception. Some of the refugios also had hot food that could be ordered during the day, mostly pizza and burgers. This food is separate from the pre-paid meals that many hikers buy, which are served on a schedule and I would not depend on this food to get through the hike. Because the dining area cannot accommodate everyone at once, the meal service for pre-ordered food is staggered. Again, this is the basic structure, but there is variation among refugios.\nFor check-in, passports and the PDI card are required. The PDI card is the print-out given to you when you enter the country of Chile. It apparently entitles you to tax-free charges on the stay, though it wasn’t clear to us what we actually got from it since we booked and paid for our refugios in advance. Still, at check-in, every refugio asked to see it. These requirements are annoying because it means one has to backpack with both their passport and that piece of paper.\n\n\nReservation System\nI have nothing much interesting to say about the online reservation system. Hikers completing the O must book sites separately at Vertice and Fantastico Sur, the two companies which run the refugios. Good luck lining up dates between the two. This process was incredibly difficult and complicated, and I heard other hikers complain about it as well. There are various websites and Reddit threads that tell you how to book the refugios, but the system to do so is awful, and the page where you pay looks like you’re about to download a virus.\nFor our trip, we were able to reserve all of our sites using our own gear, except for our last day. Both Cuernos and Frances were sold-out, but Frances had the fancier canvas tents available (for $200). We booked that because we had no choice if we wanted to do the hike on our allotted timeline. Despite our purchase email from Fantastico Sur (which uses the website LasTorres.com and at last check wasn’t working) saying we would receive a separate confirmation email, we never did despite repeated attempts to email Las Torres (in Spanish). It didn’t matter as check-in basically consisted of showing your ID, and the worker checking their list to match your name.\nVertice owns the refugios of Dickson, Los Perros and Grey. Their reservation system requires that you book stays at each of those for three consecutive nights, even though it is not a park requirement that you stop at all three. As detailed in the hike summary, it appears to be perfectly acceptable to skip Dickson and go directly to Los Perros from Seron, but Vertice requires you to have a reservation at Dickson. We did just that, and lost our $10. It’s not a lot of money, but demonstrates the general approach Vertice and Fantastico Sur take, which is basically to extract as much profit out of the system as possible.\nWhen booking the refugio stays, there is also an option to purchase breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We faced a decision about how much food we wanted to buy as we were mostly carrying our own gear and our own stove to cook our backpacking food. Still, seven days of food for two people is a lot to carry and would have made our packs very heavy. We decided to carry most of our own food but supplement it with a few meals purchased here and there, simply to reduce our pack weight. The food was almost uniformly awful, with Seron a bit of an exception. If you are a vegetarian, you simply tell them that when you check-in and they will prepare vegetarian meals, including lunches.\n\n\nThe Refugios\n\nCentro\nCentro is not a refugio proper, but a campground with showers, a bathroom, and a camping space. It’s close to the Welcome Center and the hotel, and provides access to the Base Las Torres hike. It’s also the biggest camping area. We were able to check-in when we arrived at about 9am. The workers simply gave us a sticker, told us to find an empty spot, put up our tent and attach the sticker. The bathroom area was okay (no soap though), the showers were hot in the afternoon, and we were done early enough in the day there was not a line for the showers. The cooking tent is large-ish, though not large enough, and is also where most people drop their packs for the day hike up to Las Torres. Looking back, Centro was neither particularly nice nor objectionable. The bathrooms could have been nicer and cleaner, but the camping area is fine, and hikers are able to spread out a little bit.\n\n\nSeron\nSeron is a Fantastico Sur refugio and seemed to be the second smallest (after Los Perros), but also had the most helpful employees. The camping area is a big field near the buildings, and there was plenty of space to camp away from people if one wanted. However, the wind was howling when we were there, so most people pitched their tent close to the hillside on the northeast or southeast side of the field in order to get some shelter. There were two bathroom stalls and showers separated by gender, though that broke down pretty quickly as lines formed for each. The water was hot and the shower was fine. By the morning, one of the toilets stopped flushing.\n The camping area at Seron for the refugio owned tents on platforms. Lots of space, but not a lot of protection from the wind.\nWe thought we’d purchased dinner, breakfast, and lunch for Frances, but when we arrived at Seron, the employees told us that we actually had meals there. There are two dinner seatings because the inside dining area at Seron is small. I’m not sure if you could order other food here, but there are coolers with sodas and alcohol, along with some snacks. Our dinner was split pea soup, salmon on rice pilaf, and a shared salad with bread. It was not bad and at the time I thought, okay, the food in these refugios might actually be decent. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, yogurt, and the like, lunch was a salmon, mayo, and onion mix sandwich that was better than it sounds. It also came with some trail mix. The vegetarian version was sauteed, marinated vegetables with fresh tomatoes that the vegetarian in our group thought was good.\n\n\nDickson\nWe did not spend the night at Dickson so I can’t provide much feedback on it. The buildings looked nice enough, the cooking and eating area was not heated when we were there, despite being attached to the main building, and the bathroom was small. It was very annoying that when we walked up in the pouring rain we stood around for a minute or two trying to figure out which building to head to for a warmup while a group of employees sat on the porch and watched us without bothering to give us any directions.\n Dickson camping area.\n\n\nLos Perros\nThe smallest and almost certainly the worst refugio, though our experience at Paine Grande was a close second. The campground itself is in a stand of trees that provided decent shelter from the wind but didn’t offer much space. The cooking and eating area was tiny, and there were queues to do both for most of the night. The cooking tent also become very hot with all the stoves and bodies moving around in there. The bathrooms were tiny and gross, and there was no hot water. People had clearly used the shower to wash off their shoes and mud was splattered everywhere. It had rained a lot so much of the area surrounding the buildings was extremely muddy, which made it difficult to walk around in camp shoes. By the morning, the toilets in both the men’s and women’s bathrooms were clogged and didn’t flush. The whole place was very dirty and didn’t feel taken care of at all.\n The camping area at Los Perros, which wasn tight on space but had decent shelter from the wind.\n\n\nGrey\nGrey is certainly nicer and bigger than both Seron and Los Perros, though the attitude of the employees left something to be desired. The shower and bathroom areas were also larger and cleaner, with hot water and soap. Grey’s cooking and eating area was only three tables, but it felt bigger than either Los Perros or Seron. We ate breakfast at Grey, which consisted of a small buffet with really bad coffee, okay eggs, stale bread (which ran out halfway through service), yogurts, cereals, and juice. We also ordered lunch, and it was terrible. I couldn’t actually tell what the meat-based sandwich was made of, as it looked and tasted like dog food, while the vegetarian option was smashed lime beans on bread that was basically tasteless. They did give us Toblerones in the lunches.\nThe camping area seemed a bit more spread out and was in pine trees, which provided some protection from the wind and didn’t feel too crowded. Grey might have the nicest camping area in terms of space and privacy.\n\n\nPaine Grande\nThe refugio feels much bigger than anything hikers encounter up to that point, but it also feels extremely crowded. The ferry to Pudeto stops at Paine Grande and it is the one refugio that all the W and O hikers share, as well as other hikers who use it as a base to see Grey Glacier. There is a bar upstairs in the refugio, though it was extremely crowded after about 4pm. The bathrooms are relatively far from the camping area, but are basically fine. The problem was that the employees closed them for cleaning at about 8pm, when everyone is getting ready for bed, and they were closed again at about 7am, when everyone was waking up. They couldn’t clean them during off hours? It was nice that both the bathrooms and showers were at least cleaned somewhat regularly, and there were no giant queues to use them. The cooking room at Paine Grande was the biggest and nicest, had the most plugs and outlets of any refugio, and while it seemed a little dirty in the cooking area, the seating area was fine. I heard from some other hikers that the employees kicked them out of the cooking area at exactly 10pm, despite them being in the middle of making their dinner.\nWe paid for our dinner at Paine, which consisted of a buffet of chicken and beef, along with mashed potatoes, beans, hummus, bread, and some little desserts. The chicken and at least one of the desserts were edible. Breakfast was similarly terrible, with runny eggs, and the standard yogurts, cereals, etc. Lunch was again terrible sandwiches, with the vegetarian option consisting almost entirely of smashed black beans smeared between two pieces of white bread. I can’t remember what the non-vegetarian option was because I threw it out. It baffled me that they gave hikers some energy powder for their water. Who wants to mix that into their bladder or water bottles while on a hike? There was some trail mix, dried fruit, and other stuff, but I basically threw this entire lunch in the trash.\nThe camping area at Paine Grande is the worst among the refugios. The refugio itself is located at the bottom of a canyon, and the wind blows straight down the canyon all day long, and for us, into the night. There are a few barricades setup to offer some protection to tents, but a lot of the ground behind the barricades was extremely uneven and dusty. We thought we got lucky by being able to setup behind a barricade, but quickly realized that the lack of grass meant dust constantly blew into our tent.\n The camping area at Paine Grande. Good views, but this area completely filled up with tents in the evening, and it was very windy.\nIt was very crowded, with tents packed into the camping area. On our stay, it began raining around 9 or 10pm, the wind picked up, and nearly every hiker was inside their tent. Because we were all basically on top of each other, talking in one tent meant everyone else could hear their conservation. The crowds also meant that people were walking to and from the distant bathroom all night, and it was just a loud chaotic scene in general.\nThe employees at Paine were those who most obviously did not give a crap about anything. We went into the minimarket and the woman working the cash register eventually looked up and rang us up after finishing her texts. When we went to check-in, two women didn’t acknowledge us at all, and the woman copped an attitude when some other hikers asked her to explain something in English. The employees blasted EDM at both dinner and breakfast into the dining room. At around 10 or 11pm, between the wind and rain, I could hear loud music and yelling, like teenagers having a party. It was the employees in their own large tent drinking and screaming! Imagine 100 people or so crammed into backpacking tents within about four feet of each other on all sides, preparing for a 13 mile hike in the rain the next day, at midnight, listening to 10 or 15 refugio employees hosting their own personal dance club. It wasn’t cute or funny, just unbelievably unprofessional and annoying. The only saving grace is that sometimes we couldn’t hear them over the wind and rain. And, we weren’t even that close to the party! I cannot believe a hiker didn’t go over to them and tell them off (or maybe they did, and the employees didn’t care). I’m not trying to be a scold as I worked in the service industry for years and I think my tolerance for bad behavior is pretty high; this was completely ridiculous. For what it’s worth, most of the employees in the morning looked hungover.\n\n\nFrances\nFrances is situated in some trees on a hill, and while nice looking, it’s a bit of a haul up and down to the bathrooms and minimart. The buildings look the newest, and the bathrooms and showers seem to be in the best shape. My biggest gripe with Frances, besides the walk up and down to the store and bathrooms, is that there are smaller, separated cooking and eating areas, but they are much too small and don’t provide much protection from the elements. For us in the rain, we were basically cooking and sitting outside, which was cold (though dry). Still, the camping area is a little more spread out and Frances just seemed newer and nicer than the other refugios.\n This is a bad picture, but it’s the inside of our $200 canvas tent. The tent is off the ground and completely encased in heavy canvas with a soft mat on the bottom.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe refugio situation should not stop anyone from doing the hike, but everyone should know that the situation is bad. They are small, crowded, dirty, the food is bad, and the employee attitudes ranged from mild indifference to outright hostility. The online booking and reservation system is its own problem. I don’t have much hope for improvement given the overwhelming popularity of the hike, but I think it’s important that hikers realize what they are getting into. Maybe more public complaints to the park or government will force some improvement.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "title": "Problems with the O",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am trying to balance realism with pessimism, and be honest without being too negative. Let me reiterate what my experience was: the scenery was absolutely world-class, about the best I’ve ever seen, especially for such a long duration hike. All seven days offered incredible views. As I mentioned before, there is almost no step on the trail where there isn’t something amazing to look at.\nThe problems seem recent in development, which makes it feel like one of those things so common to people my age and younger: “you should have seen it back then”.\nThe refugio system is covered in its own section here, though I discuss the reservation system.\n\nCrowds\nThe trail is crowded, at least compared to places I’m used to hiking in the Mountain West. The backside of the O is less crowded than the W side, but because everyone leaves from the same refugios at roughly the same time, you are almost never alone. Hikers are almost always within shouting distance of one another.\nThe front side, which includes W hikers going both directions, is even more crowded. Not only are hikers within shouting distance of one another, they are almost always within visual distance of each other as well. Crowds can be annoying in that it changes the feel of the hike, but most hikers were nice people and a little bit of a community forms after a few days.\nIt did feel like we were constantly having to negotiate passing and being passed on the trails. For example, if we passed a large, slower group, I’d be afraid of taking too long getting a picture 200 yards up the trail for fear of being passed by the group again. We found ourselves hop-scotching other groups frequently, and woe to the hiker that has the misfortune of being stuck behind a 10 or 15 person tour group. Most groups and hikers will let faster walkers pass, but this was far from universal.\nThe hike to the Towers is its own animal. It was packed, and we were almost always in a line of hikers. Most of these people are day visitors, most of them are slow hikers, and most of them have no sense of trail etiquette. Stopping in the middle of the trail to take a picture or re-adjust things? Check. Refusing to let faster hikers pass? Check. Refusing to yield to uphill hikers? Check. Stepping in front of incoming hikers only to go slow? Check.\n Another picture of the crowds coming up to Las Torres. This was by far the most crowded hike on the circuit.\nThe Towers hike was by far the worst, but these problems exist to some extent on the entire trail, though the stretch around Grey, Paine Grande and Italiano was worse than on the backside. Again, the crowds aren’t disqualifying, but they are a thing.\n\n\nThe Refugio System and Scheduling\nI detail the exact problems with the refugio system here, so this is a slightly different issue mentioned to me by a few other hikers. Because you need reservations at each of the refugios, and because you must stay at the refugios, it’s impossible to keep your own schedule. If you aren’t feeling well and want a rest day, you can’t decide to take one. If you are feeling strong and want to keep hiking, you can’t. In other words, it isn’t really a self-directed hike because you must stay on the schedule dictated by the refugio system. As mentioned, a lot of the mileage between the refugios was too low for us, but there wasn’t anything we could do about it. If something goes wrong, like a missed bus or delayed bag, you have to try and rebook all your reservations. It’s just not a system that gives hikers any freedom over their itinerary.\n\n\nTrail Conditions\nThe trail itself is a disaster, which makes the hiking much harder than similar miles in the U.S. on forest service or national park system trails. We joked that the trail is an old guanaco trail as it seems graded for animals rather than humans. Switchbacks? Never heard of them. It’s just an old-timey trail, similar to the AT in that it goes up and down seemingly without reason, rather than gaining and holding elevation or taking an efficient route. Okay, most experienced hikers can deal with that.\nThe real problem is that much of the trail was basically destroyed and extremely muddy. I recognize this sounds like a minor inconvenience, but when you are constantly having to walk through and around mud, for miles and miles on end, it becomes exceedingly tedious and tiring. It was almost impossible to keep our boots dry. And, the later in the day you hike a section, the worse the trail conditions become. We hiked through almost nonstop rain, so I’m guessing the mud is not as bad in the middle of summer or during sunny weather, but the mud really, really slowed us down. Further, because of the way the trail is graded, the mud makes steep sections exceedingly slick and dangerous. The section from the top of the pass to Grey in particular was more of a full body workout than a hike, as one constantly has to sit down to shimmy down steep sections, grab trees for balance, scramble down rocks, and generally negotiate a slick and steep trail that would not be out of place in a rainforest. Again, it is hard to say how much of the mud was due to the rain, and how much conditions improve if things are dry, but my sense is that some amount of mud is always present. Besides the section from the pass to Grey, the Dickson to Los Perros section was also in very poor conditions. It was muddier and longer, but less steep, which made it a little bit more manageable.\n Miles and miles of mud made for difficult and slow hiking.\nIn other areas, particularly after Cuernos, small creeks run down the trails. I would assume there would be less water if it wasn’t raining, but it’s clear the trail has been eroded enough that the creek bed is now the trail. There is a lot of rock hopping here, which makes the going slow. The water and mud issues have caused hikers to create side trails, and in many places there is a zig-zagging network of trails as hikers move around the mud and water. And in some places, there is almost no way to avoid going off trail and contributing to the problem. One pool near Cuernos was probably six inches deep across the entire trail between bushes–there was simply no way to avoid getting your feet wet without going off trail. The creation of these side-trail networks is the National Park Service’s worst nightmare and I now understand why they spend so much time and energy telling people to remain on the trails, and why they close wet trails.\nAt some point, CONAF is going to have to engage in some serious trail building to fix these problems. Given the crowds and weather, these trail conditions are simply unsustainable, not to mention the impact on the environment.\n\n\nCosts\nChile in general is not cheap, and in some ways the bureaucracy around the hike seems designed to squeeze every dollar possible out of visitors. Here is a summary of our costs, beginning with the bus to the park.\n\nBus ticket, Puerto Natales to Laguna Amarga: $10/person\nShuttle bus ticket, Laguna Amarga to Welcome Center $3.77/person\nPark Entrance ticket: $49/person\nSeron campsite for two people: $50\nBreakfast, lunch, and dinner at Seron : $88/person\nDickson campsite for two people: $20 (didn’t use)\nLos Perros campsite for two people: $20\nGrey campsite for two people: $20\nBreakfast and lunch at Grey: $38/person\nPaine Grande campsite for two people: $24\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner at Paine Grande: $70/person\nFrances campsite for two people: $50\nCanvas tent at Frances: $200\nShuttle bus ticket, Welcome Center to Laguna Amarga: $3.77/person\nBus ticket, Laguna Amarga to Puerto Natales: $10/person\nTotal cost per person (including campsites for two people): $656.54\n\n\n\nThe Weather\nThis one is hard because I don’t know what normal weather is, but it’s Patagonia, and the park is near the ocean, which pumps a lot of moisture through. For us, we hiked in the rain, camped in the rain, ate in the rain, and slept in the rain. I actually got used to it after a few days. The wind was also bad, but that’s more normal than the amount of rain we experienced.\nIt was intermittently cold, though not overwhelmingly so. With rain comes clouds, and lack of views. I just don’t know how to conceptualize dealing with the weather because if you can’t see anything, it’s not worth going. But how many hikers complete the O every year and have bad weather for a few of their hiking days? A few? Some? Most? There is no easy way to think about this, but honestly, if I’d known how bad the weather would be, I’m not sure I would have done the hike.\n Thick clouds ruined a lot of the views.\nIf one could absolutely guarantee good weather, I think the good definitely outweighs the bad, but with the uncertainty, it becomes a more difficult decision. When I asked others whether the rain was normal, the typical response was something like, “es Patagonia,” meaning it’s Patagonia, what are you going to do? My fishing guide canceled our fishing trip because he said it was the worst summer weather he’d ever seen, which gives some indication as to how unusual this was. But, the rain we experienced wasn’t a week-long event. Most people I talked to said it had been going on for almost the entire month of February, and was expected to continue through much of March. Hiking in the rain is miserable; hiking in the rain and not seeing anything is worse. And forget trying to plan for the weather, the forecast in the morning for the afternoon wasn’t accurate, never mind a forecast weeks or months in advance when you need to book your reservations.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "text": "We flew from the U.S. to Santiago, then to Punta Arenas. There are apparently some direct flights from Santiago to Puerto Natales, which is the jumping off point to the park, but it’s far more common to fly into Punta Arenas.\nUpon landing in Santiago, we had to gather our backpacks and clear customs, and we were immediately sent to secondary inspection. In the baggage claim area there is a paper that must be completed, and there were no working pens when we arrived, so the lesson here is, have a pen on you (not in your baggage). I’m guessing almost everyone bringing a backpack into the country is sent to secondary. They x-rayed our bags, then asked us to open them. Based on our Google research, we weren’t entirely clear about what were allowed to bring into the country, but we had normal backpacker food: clif bars, cookies, jerky (in its original wrapping), powdered mash potatoes, mac and cheese, etc. After they asked us to open our bags, they asked whether we had any dried fruit (which we didn’t). It’s possible that’s the only thing they care about because they didn’t confiscate or examine any of our other food. I’m still not sure what is allowed and what isn’t, but this whole process through secondary inspection probably took about ten minutes.\nAfter landing in Punta Arenas, we stayed for three nights due to the timing of our flights and the start of our refugio reservations. This is absolutely too long in Punta Arenas but I highly recommend spending at least one night, and maybe two. One of our backpacks was lost by Latam, and it was one of about six pieces of luggage from our flight that was lost. It was found within a few hours, and when we returned to the airport to pick it up, the employees were unfazed, went back into a room that seemed to be storing a lot of luggage and returned with our backpack. It felt like luggage is lost pretty regularly and Latam has a lot of flights from Santiago to Punta Arenas. My guess is that your luggage is likely to end up on a flight to Punta Arenas, just not necessarily your flight. For this reason, I think it’s smart to give yourself at least a one day buffer in Punta Arenas, just in case your bag doesn’t make it.\nThe bus ride from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales is about three hours, and the bus station in both places is in the center of town, within easy walking distance to most hotels and hostels.\n\nLogistics to the Park from Puerto Natales\nFrom Puerto Natales, the buses takes about two hours to reach the park entrance, called Laguna Amarga, which is a cluster of official buildings outside the actual Welcome Center. Here you show your entrance ticket which you should have already purchased online, or you stand in line and buy a ticket. The system for both buying your ticket and presenting your ticket to the park officials is extremely stupid, and here’s how it works.\nThe bus pulls up to the gate, a ranger boards and tells you the rules of the park (no fires, don’t litter, etc.) Then you disembark the bus and go to an office to either show your ticket or stand in line to purchase one, along with your identification. You must have your ticket and passport on you instead of in your backpack/luggage, because your bus drives away to a parking area. If you made the mistake of leaving your ticket or passport in your backpack, you’ll have to ask permission to walk to the bus in the parking area, wait for the driver to open the luggage compartment, find your backpack, grab your ticket and passport, walk back to the building to show your ticket, then walk back to the bus and get your backpack. Of course, we had a moment of panic because one member of our party didn’t have her passport on her, but the person checking her ticket didn’t ask to see it (though she had retrieved a photo on her phone), despite the ranger who boarded the bus five minutes earlier making it clear that identification was needed. At the time we were there, tickets on the phone were acceptable.\nAfter you buy or show your ticket, you walk back to your bus, grab your stuff, then head to another park shuttle bus that will take you the approximately four miles to the Welcome Center. This shuttle bus costs 3,000 CLP. Hope you brought small denomination cash! The driver will make change, but everyone is shoving money in his face as he’s trying to rip off little slips of paper that represent your shuttle ticket. Lots of different bus companies arrive to the front gate about the same time so there may not be room on the first shuttle bus, hence the mad scramble to buy a shuttle bus ticket (and why you don’t want to have get your park ticket and passport from your luggage because you’ll end up at the back of the line). For those that miss the first shuttle bus, it will come back and take the remaining visitors, but this takes time.\nThe shuttle bus drops off passengers at the Welcome Center, which is a short walk to Centro camping area, refugio, and Hotel Torres del Paine (I believe the shuttle makes a second stop at the hotel, but I’m not sure as I got off the bus at the Welcome Center). The Welcome Center has some seating, a little cafe, and a few souvenirs, but it’s much smaller than a typical entrance station you’d find at a U.S. national park. There are also people behind a desk who will answer questions.\n\n\nLogistics from the Park to Laguna Amarga and Puerto Natales\nWhen you leave the park, you have to buy another shuttle bus ticket and repeat the process. The shuttles are not regular, but are timed with the buses. For example, our bus leaving Laguna Amarga back to Puerto Natales, was at 3pm, as were a number of other buses. The shuttle service began at 2pm from the front of the Welcome Center. Lots of people queued up for the bus starting at about 1:30pm, but the driver first called for people on buses leaving at 2pm. Because there weren’t many, he then filled the shuttle bus, to standing room, with everyone else. Buying tickets from him was almost more chaotic than on the ride into the park as the queue quickly disintegrated. I think people were really panicked about missing their bus back to Puerto Natales (and who could blame them after camping for days in the rain). Some people were left waiting at the Welcome Center because the shuttle bus filled up, but it made repeated trips, and the private buses back to Natales don’t leave until the shuttle bus has completed its rounds back-and-forth from the Welcome Center.\nThis system doesn’t work nearly as efficiently as it should as hikers jockey for position, and buying the shuttle tickets is disorganized and confusing, especially with the bus driver shouting instructions in Spanish to a group of people who mostly don’t speak Spanish. You could always walk the four miles.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

Both hikes begin from the same parking lot and can be done separately or together. While neither hike is particularly long, the combination of them together is a good warmup for the O.

    "text": "Most visitors to the area are going to fly into Punta Arenas, though that may change as more flights are scheduled to Puerto Natales. My flight from Santiago was full of Americans on various tours to Antarctica or headed to Torres del Paine. I originally thought I was going on an extreme adventure to the ends of the earth, then realized my flight was full of retirees paying ten grand to sail to Antarctica. (As an aside, a hiker I met on the O took a cruise to Antarctica from Ushuia, another major jumping off point. He said the seas were so bad in the Drake Passage that fewer and fewer people showed up to each successive meal, with only about 20 out of 200 sitting down to dinner on the first night. And it was worse on the way back. As someone who gets motion-sickness, no thank you.)\nI think two nights in Punta Arenas is plenty. As I detail in the logistics section, one of our backpacks was lost on the flight from Santiago to Arenas and this seems like a fairly common occurrence. Six other people lost their bags on our flight, including a woman who was due to start her hike the next day. Our bag was found within about five hours, but I would really feel more comfortable having at least about one day as flex time, just in case a bag doesn’t make it. Most flights land in the late morning or early afternoon so using the rest of that day to explore the town, then the next day to complete the Mount Tarn and/or Faro San Isidro hike, with departures on the following day, should be plenty of time in Punta Arenas.\nThere really isn’t much to see in the town, and that’s okay! Not every town has to have a cutesy, instragrammable downtown vibe. Arenas definitely does not. It feels a little bit gritty, a little rundown, and just about the perfect place to walk along the waterfront and process how close you are to Antarctica after flying for 24 hours. Having said that, we spent four nights because we couldn’t line up cheap plane flights and camping reservations for the O, and that was definitely (at least) one night too many.\n Windswept is an overused adjective, but it fits Punta Arenas.\nTo be honest, I was pretty much done with Arenas by the time we left. There is is only so much walking around town I can do, and aside from the hikes out of town that require a rental car, there wasn’t much else. The food was not all that great and I wish I could recommend some restaurants, but I can’t. The seafood market is only open during the day, but it’s worth a visit for lunch.\nWhen we landed, we took a taxi from the airport to our hotel. In other Latin American countries I’ve traveled in, especially Mexico, you do not solicit taxis from the guys standing in the airport. Instead, taxis should be booked from official stands inside the airport (taxi sitios), or alternatively, one should use Uber. When we landed, there was a small stand for taxi sitios, but it was empty. We also tried to use Uber, but there were no cars available at the airport, though Ubers are sometimes available in the town itself.\nAfter dealing with our missing baggage, we got a taxi after two drivers tried to entice us with competing offers. There is a very small sign in the airport that says trips from the airport to downtown are at a fixed price of 11,000 CLP, though the competition between the two drivers at the airport led them to a price of 10,000. After we got in the taxi, I made sure to confirm that it would be 10,000 CLP. This is important as another taxi ride from the airport didn’t work out as well.\nWe were dropped off at our hotel and spent some time chatting with an agent at LATAM. Eventually they told us that a bag matching our bag’s description had been found and was ready to be picked up. Our hotel called us another taxi, which we took back to the airport (about a 20 minute ride) and we got our bag, then took the same taxi back to our hotel. From there we walked to a bar and had dinner. The next day we walked around town. There is a decent sidewalk along the waterfront with monuments and some other interesting sights, though it’s nothing all that spectacular. We ate at the seafood market that was somewhere between okay and decent, but the market itself is a cool experience. It was crowded, and it was hard to know which restaurant to choose among the competing options. Our choice was more or less random. Afterward, we walked through the cemetery which is worth a visit, and also visited the hill park, called Cerro de la Cruz, which offers decent views of the town.\n One of the monuments along the waterfront.\nThe day after, we took an Uber to the airport to pick up our rental car. We spent the entire day hiking Mount Tarn and to the lighthouse, then drove back to the airport at night to drop the rental car off. It was about 8pm and there were no flights landing, so there was only one taxi waiting. I asked him about the price and he said he’d turn on the meter. Well, the same taxi ride that cost us 10,000 CLP when we landed was 25,000 CLP on the meter. I argued with the guy as he was obviously trying to rip us off. He said he wasn’t an airport taxi, despite the fact he was sitting at the airport. He very generously gave me 5,000 CLP back after arguing with him, so it only cost double what the first trip cost.\nOur last day in Arenas we walked around more, went to the Zona Franca, which is a shopping mall with some sort of tax discounts on goods. There are a few outdoor stores here so we bought a gas can for our hike; other outdoor gear is available. We just didn’t have a lot to do on this, our third full day, in town.\n Punta Arenas From Cerro de la Cruz, a small park on a hill.\n Magellan monument in downtown Arenas.\n\nPuerto Natales\nNatales is a nicer town, and closer to a cliche “backpacker” town. It’s smaller, there is more of a downtown area with stores, restaurants, bars and the like. The food was certainly better, even if it was mostly pizza and burgers rather than anything approaching “Chilean” though there are some restaurants which serve lamb dishes and seafood. Puerto Natales is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, mostly because it’s full of tourists doing touristy things and preparing to travel to the park.\nWe were in Natales for four nights; one night was before we left for the park and just had time for dinner and a a short walk after arriving on the bus. That night we stayed at a small hostel that was quite enjoyable (see below). The second night was when we returned from the park and again, just had dinner. The third night we walked and did some shopping, saw what few sights there were to see (the cemetery, the dock area), and the fourth night was supposed to be after my fishing trip, which was canceled due to high water. Because I was supposed to be fishing that last day, I really had no idea what to do in town. The weather was bad anyway, and I had absolutely no desire to walk around town in the rain after having spent the last week doing that in the mountains. Three nights would have been more than sufficient, and even two nights, pre- and post-park visits, would be just fine.\nFor the nights after our hike, we stayed in a relatively upscale hotel as a reward to us that was a bit outside of town, but definitely walkable from the town center. Our hotel allowed us to store a suitcase there for the week we were hiking which was nice as we didn’t have to go back to our hostel to get it, and we didn’t have to drag it into the park.\n\n\nOur Lodging and Recommended Restaurants\n\nFour nights in Punta Arenas\n\nStayed at Patagonia Apart\n\nFour nights in Puerto Natales\n\nStayed at Hostal Asio before the hike.\nStayed at Weskar Lodge after the hike.\n\nRestaurants/bars in Natales\n\nLast Hope Distillery (super popular, crowded, try to arrive before the 5pm opening to queue for the first seating and distillery tour, even though the tour takes too long.)\nBasecamp Pizza\nWild Restobar & Cervecería\nJAU Natales Restaurante\nBirra! Cerveza and Buena Mesa (in Punta Arenas)\n\n\nThese are all in Puerto Natales as I didn’t eat a single place in Arenas I thought was worthwhile (other than Birra which is a beer bar more than a restaurant.) Places come and go quickly so no promises any of the above restaurants stay in business.\nBack to O Hike Overview"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I was skeptical about Pyramid Lake, Nevada when I first received an invitation to fish it in April 2023. I hate fishing stillwater, and giant lakes don’t seem to present much of a thrill. In my opinion, there’s no strategy, no problem-solving, and no thinking involved. You throw your line in at a seemingly random spot on the shore and hope for the best. I also, admittedly, know very little about catching large fish using a rod bigger than a four or five weight. My friend who invited me promised a quick casting demonstration for his two-handed seven weight and that he’d take care of the necessary flies. The chance to catch very, very large cutthroat was enticing. I don’t believe I’ve ever caught a trout over 20 inches, and I think most casual anglers who claim to have done so are rounding up from 17 or 18.\nLOL, well the joke was on me. Despite recent online reports promising hot fishing, we caught exactly one cutthroat between the two of us, for an average catch rate of .25 fish per person per day. You can guess which one of us caught the one trout (hint: it wasn’t me). The poor fishing continued a string of bad luck. My last attempt to fish ended in failure as the water in Patagonia, Chile was completely blown out. I did foul-hook one of the sucker fish that also live in the lake so it wasn’t a total shut-out, though I don’t really count non-game, foul hooked fish. The camping experience and scenery were better than I expected, the fishing much, much worse. It happens.\n\nLogistics\nCamping and fishing at Pyramid Lake requires two special permits. Because the lake is on the Pauite Indian Reservation a regular Nevada fishing license is not useful. Instead, a special fishing license, which is $24 a day (as of 2023), is required. In addition, one must purchase a camping permit at $32 a day. Two days at Pyramid Lake, even with just a tent and a few hot dogs, is not cheap.\nThe vast majority of visitors will come from the Reno area, driving north on the 445 to Sutcliffe, Nevada, Here you can buy both your camping and fishing permits from the ranger station, though both can also be purchased online as well. We bought camping permits online and fishing permits in person, partially to have an excuse to go into the ranger station and ask about fishing reports and camping possibilities. The woman who sold us the fishing permits mentioned something about needing to have a paper copy of the fishing permits on hand, but it wasn’t 100% clear to me that she meant a copy on your phone wasn’t sufficient. Buying your fishing permit in person, where they print it off for you, was easy enough, though when we showed up, there was no one at the counter and we had to wait about 20 minutes along with some other would-be anglers. There are basically no signs directing visitors to the ranger station where one can buy licenses, but it is on Lakeview Drive in Sutcliffe, next to the Pyramid Lake Marina.\nThe 445 continues north along the lake shore and passes various places to camp. The first two obvious spots are Pelican Bay and Windless Bay. The ranger station has paper maps that are borderline useless, but they do list various beaches and camping spots, though there are no mileage markers or other information that identifies where one is on the map. We were told by the woman who sold us the licenses that, “you can camp anywhere you can fish, just 100 yards from the water’s edge.”\n\n\nWindless and Pelican Bays\nPelican Bay and Windless Bay both have a Florida Gulf Coast beach vibe to them. The locals park their RVs in circles or lines, hang out in beach chairs, and wander out to their ladders when the mood strikes. The scene was country music (though one RV played Steve Goodman’s Go Cubs Go twice!), beer, and American flags, along with lots of people not catching fish. I heard it can get pretty rowdy at night, but everyone was very friendly when we showed up to squeeze our ladders in. The guys fishing next to us were happy to exchange tips and fishing reports. It’s just not the place for those seeking solitude. My impression is Pelican Bay is fairly similar though we didn’t fish there. If anything, it looked more crowded than Windless.\n The Windless Bay RV scene. The empty ladders on left are a good indication of the quality of the fishing that day.\n\n\nYes You Need a Ladder\nAh yes, the requisite ladders! If you’re reading this, you probably don’t have a custom-made chair ladder and that’s okay. Regular house ladders are absolutely essential and necessary, however, and the bigger the better. I had a standard six foot house ladder and my friend had a smaller stepstool. The stepstool was not as useful. The ladder serves a few purposes. Most obviously, it gives you between 10 and 20 additional feet out into the water. The idea, as far as I understand it (keeping in mind I didn’t catch any fish), is to cast to the edge of the drop-off, where the water becomes much deeper. Apparently the trout cruise the area at the edge of the shelf and the drop-off, and the ladder makes it possible to cast from the water much closer to the drop-off. The ladder also gets one’s body out of the cold water, making it easier to stay in the lake longer. I was worried I’d get extremely uncomfortable having to stand on a ladder for long periods of time, but it wasn’t really that bad. I got used to sort of bracing myself against the top steps, taking some weight off my feet and reducing the stiffness that comes from standing on your feet without moving. Depending on the location we were fishing, the bottom was sandy or slightly rocky, but in either case it wasn’t too difficult to find a place to setup the ladder. The stepstool seemed to sink into the sand a little bit more and overall just wasn’t as stable in the water. Because it was much shorter, it wasn’t as easy to lean against when casting as the taller ladder, which actually made it more uncomfortable to fish from (as well as being colder).\n Most of these are custom chair ladders. Exactly one of these people caught one fish in the two hours or so I was fishing at Windless.\n\n\nOther Camping Options\nWe continued north on the 445 and the farther up the coast one goes, the thinner the crowd gets. There are turnouts and networks of dirt roads with obvious camping sites and it’s pretty straightforward to drive along and pull over at a place that looks promising. We turned off the road at Warrior Point, which is labeled with a sign and has pit toilets, some small shelters, picnic tables, and established fire pits at many of the sites. Fires are allowed in these unofficial pits and we had a nice camping experience with solitude, good weather and pleasant scenery. The colors of the bright blue lake, brown mountains, snow-capped peaks, and white clouds were really striking at times. Be aware there are no trees anywhere, so I could imagine it getting very hot later in the season.\n Dusk from our campsite.\nThere are also a few rock outcroppings at Warrior Point (and other points along the coast) that seem to drop directly into deeper water, so ladders are not necessary in these spots. If one didn’t have a ladder, these are good options for places to fish, though only being able to fish the rocks will be somewhat limiting. I have no idea if the fishing is good off these points, though they seemed to be quite popular fishing spots.\nThe lake was glassy both days we were there with almost no wind. Of course, this is what the locals chose to blame the bad fishing on (“weather is too good”). We stripped foam beetles, wooly buggers, and other typical Pyramid flies, and dropped chironomids beneath bobbers. We could see the native sucker fish and the occasional trout swimming around in the shallows, and the few fish stories we heard suggested the fish were very close to the ladders, not out at the drop-off. We also saw a number of fish come to the surface 100 to 200 yards past where we could cast. In desperation, we tied on dry flies at one point and tried to cast out closer to those fish. No dice, it just wasn’t happening for us. I wouldn’t mind returning to Pyramid Lake, in spite of my bias against stillwater fishing, but it won’t be in 2023.\n\nBack to Main Page"

I could find very little information online about the fishing in Deer Creek, so I had almost no idea what to expect. I only later learned about a detailed post from Keep Calm and Fly Fish. My total experience on Deer Creek is two hours, so I won’t go into as much detail here. I will say that after fishing it for a few hours, it’s definitely worth a stop, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to fish it.\n\nRiver Access and Wading\nAt the eastern end of 32, the creek begins in a large meadow and in the Summer of 2023 there was sufficient water to make it look like a very enticing spot. Unfortunately, when I drove by, there were a lot of people in the meadow so I decided to keep going and fish a little lower. Heading west on 32, there are a number of turnouts and access points along the creek. I probably traveled five miles or so downstream (west) of the meadow before I pulled over and walked down to the river at a random spot.\nIt looks very much like a slightly smaller version of my home river, the Logan. It’s a freestone stream with clear water and lots of structure for fish. I used my typical dry-dropper setup with a mayfly attractor and generic prince nymph. This type of stream is what I’m most used to fishing, so I think I’m typically pretty good at reading the water and knowing where the fish are going to be. It didn’t take long before I brought a few fish to the net.\nMy first hour or so was quite good, and I probably hooked five fish or so. The wading was easy so I covered ground moving upstream. Virtually all the fish I caught were on the nymph, but that’s okay, it’s still fun. My biggest gripe is that I didn’t catch a fish more than about eight or nine inches. It sure felt like Deer Creek should support bigger fish, but even the deeper holes didn’t turn up anything bigger.\nThings definitely slowed down by early afternoon as the weather got hotter. Having caught my share of seven inch fish, I packed it in. I liked Deer Creek. There were a few people here and there, but the crowds seemed pretty minimal, in that it was easy to find a stretch of river I could have to myself.

    "text": "Utah introduced its cutt slam shortly after I learned how to consistently catch fish on the fly and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. The slam forced me to learn more about the fish I was catching, explore waters I normally wouldn’t, and challenge myself by learning new techniques to tackle unfamilitar waters.\nWhile I extensively researched the places I’d fish for my challenge, I was frustrated with a lot of the information I read from other sources. I found most websites to be long on fish pictures and short on details. This made things difficult when deciding where and how I’d fish because I was unsure what kinds of flies to use (though I think this is largely overrated), the type of water I’d be fishing, or public access.\nThe most important thing for me when fishing is to have an overall enjoyable experience: good fishing, small crowds, and nice scenery. For most of us, it isn’t feasible to drive four or five hours to a fishing spot, only to realize that there isn’t public access or the creek is full of tiny brook trout. Because of my frustrations with other online information, this site is short on pictures but, I hope, long on details. I mostly skip the grip-and-grin fish pictures, and focus on the water and scenery. When researching my own slams I wanted to know what the water looked like to get a sense of its size and type. In general, I know what fish look like.\n\nN.B.: I know it’s considered by many to be problematic to post locations of good fishing spots, but all the waters described here can be found on the state wildlife agency websites, on other personal websites, and in many Youtube videos so I’m not giving away any secrets. Also, most of these spots (with a few exceptions) are not exactly blue ribbon, 20-inch fish, trout streams. The vast majority of waters I have fished, especially in Utah and Nevada, are small and brushy with small fish. I write about the Logan and other Cache Valley rivers in greater detail because these are my local fishing spots, but the Logan is already well-known as high quality fly fishing river. A google search for “Logan River fishing” shows the first two results are from visitUtah.com and Utah.com. I hope this information is valuable for others interested in fly fishing and pursuing native trout challenges.\nI also want to note that I receive no compensation from this website, and none of the products I recommend or equipment I use are sponsored.\nA summary of my completed and in progress slams can be found here. I provide details on where and how I caught my fish. Unless otherwise noted, all fish were caught on dry flies and released.

    "text": "While in the McCloud River area working on my California Heritage Trout Challenge, I took a day to fish the Lower McCloud below McCloud Resevoir. The river runs through a steep and narrow canyon and access is limited by the geography and private land. I made reservations at the Nature Conservancy-Kerry Landreth Preserve, which offers some of the only publicly-available access along the river in this area. The Preserve is well publicized online and a number of local fly shops offer guided trips on the river. It seems to be as famous a fly fishing water as exists in the state of California and I was excited for my day there. I’ll cut to the chase: I didn’t like it for reasons I’ll detail below. I guess I’m glad I gave it a shot, but it’s not high on the list for a return visit.\n\nLogistics\nFishing the Nature Conservancy property requires a permit/tag, which can be reserved online or one can take their chances by walking up. There are ten total tags, half available via reservation and half available to walk-up anglers. The good news is the reservation is free so there is no real cost of making one then not showing up, other than taking up a spot for another angler. I was surprised that I was able to make a reservation about a week before my visit, and when I arrived, only two reservation tags were used, and none of the walk-up tags were taken. It was in the middle of the week, but this was mid-July, seemingly prime fishing season. Though there are only ten tags, there are cabins on the Nature Conservancy property and people staying in those cabins apparently do not have to reserve tags. While only two tags were taken on my visit, there were at least five people fishing the river. It wasn’t a big deal in terms of crowds as the property has between two and three miles of river, but I could imagine a full complement of ten anglers plus another ten or so from the cabins (I’m not sure how many people can stay in them) making for a somewhat crowded day.\nThe Preserve is accessed down a bad forest road that dead ends near the preserve entrance. Parking is a bit tricky as there are only a few dedicated spots and some turnouts. Again, it’s tough to imagine the parking situation on a crowded day. The real issue is the road. From the town of McCloud, a paved road leads down toward the lake then splits off from a road to the boat ramp and turns into a good forest road that climbs along the western shore while heading south. There is another right turn, the road climbs higher until it reaches an intersection, then descends to the southwest into the McCloud drainage below the dam. These turns are mostly not signed and drivers need to pay attention to the direction they’re headed. Near the Preserve, there are a few side roads that go down to the river, but stay on the main road which hugs the slope and continues parallel to the river until the road dead-ends.\nFrom the first turnoff onto the dirt road to the end of the road, it’s about seven miles, and from the top of the ridge down into the canyon, the road is absolutely horrible. It does not require four wheel drive, at least when the road is dry, but it is incredibly bumpy and rocky, making for a miserable driving experience. On the way out, it took me about 45 minutes to travel the seven miles. It honestly feels like the road quality is kept this way intentionally to make sure only dedicated anglers reach the water, and to make the experience feel more adventurous, like you’re heading into the wilderness. All it actually did was annoy me and extend my time in the car; there is no excuse for the Forest Service or the Nature Conservancy or whomever owns the road not to do some basic maintenance.\n\n\nRiver Access and Wading\nUpon parking at the road terminus, one must walk about a quarter of a mile to reach the camp itself. There is a bulletin board explaining the logistics of the tags, reporting requirements, etc. It’s all very straightforward. The camp has a bathroom, water, tables, and shade. From the camp, a trail parallels the river, allowing anglers to spread out downstream. Unfortunately, access is not as easy as it sounds. The trail stays above the river, anywhere from five to ten feet, and the canyon is very steep in most places. When an angler sees a place they want to fish, they need to scramble down the bank through bushes and rocks to access the river. In many spots, this isn’t particularly easy or possible, especially if the brush is thick or the embankment is particularly steep. As a result, anglers tend to favor a few particular spots and in these spots there tend to be obvious side trails down to the river. My issue with all of this is that it’s difficult to work the river in the way I’d like, moving around, hitting long stretches of water by wading or bank walking upstream. Instead, I had to negotiate the brush and rocks down to a spot, fish it for awhile, hike back up to the trail, walk down the trail to the next accessible spot and do it all over again. It also means despite the three possible river miles in which to fish, most people congregate at a few obvious, accessible holes. The fish in these holes almost certainly see a ton of flies.\nThe wading was also very challenging. Other people I spoke to seemed shocked I didn’t have a wading staff! I’ve never used a wading staff in my life, and I wasn’t about to buy one for this particular river, but I acknowledge it would have been helpful. The river seemed very high to me, but the guide I spoke with said it was only slightly higher than normal. The river was definitely bankfull and while there were spots where one could conceivably wade to near the center of the river, I was completely limited to hugging the eddies along the side of the river. I also found the river quite slick, though admittedly, my wading boots are worn out and do not grip as well as they should. The flow and the slickness, combined with the cloudy water which limited visibility and made it impossible to see where I was stepping, meant I had to pick a spot and stand there.\nAs I mentioned before, this is not how I like to fish. I almost always wade upstream and cover a lot of ground. This allows me to find fish, figure out what’s working and what isn’t, and discover the intricacies of the river. On the McCloud, I could only stand and fish a hole for awhile, then climb back up the bank, walk down the trail, and repeat the process. Looking back, I realize I couldn’t find any rhythm, and I feel like I spent a lot of my time walking the trail rather than fishing.\n\n\nFishing Quality\nWell, aside from that how was the fishing? Total crap. I hooked one 12 inch rainbow trout that broke off before I could net it. Aside from that, not a thing. Most people were using nymphs suspended about three feet beneath bobbers or indicators, and I initially tried my standard prince nymph with hare’s ear or zebras, in size 12 and 14 or 16. I spoke with a guide who said my nymph rig was too deep and too small. He gave me some rubber legs which were bigger, and advised I use nothing smaller than a 12, while drifting only two feet or so beneath the surface. I tried that for awhile and nothing happened.\nIn fact, the guide I spoke with said his client had some success in the morning, then radio silence. I asked every other person I came across on the trail whether they were having success and they uniformly said no. In fact, one of the cabin guests laughed and said they hadn’t caught anything the day before either. I am completely aware that I need to do a better job of adjusting my technique to the water I’m fishing, and my preferred style of working the river upstream just wasn’t going to work on the McCloud. But, it really doesn’t help when I’m not catching anything after hours and hours of fishing in the heat. At about 2 p.m., after starting at 9 a.m., I got frustrated and packed it in.\nIt was slow (what else is new) and even if it wasn’t, I’m not sure how impressed I am. The kiosk at the camp had a survey form where anglers must report their catches. I wish I’d taken a picture of it because there were a few days of records on the form that I could see, and the average catch was an eight inch rainbow trout, with very few 12s and 15s mixed in. In my very humble opinion, those numbers are certainly not worth the hassle of the drive, the reservation system, etc. I hate to pull the “my local water is the best” card, but I can easily catch double-digit numbers of 12 inch trout on the Logan River any day of the week and often multiple 15+ inch fish. When going to a place like the McCloud, I’m looking for big fish (17 inch plus) and lots of them. In sum, I’m just not convinced the fishing on the lower McCloud lives up to its reputation. I look forward to your emails telling me how wrong I am.\nI apologize for the lack of pictures. I was planning on being out all day and wanted to lighten my pack, so I left my camera in the car. I used my phone to take one picture of the river. Here it is:\n This isn’t high water?\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "Hiking the Trans-Catalina Trail: Tips, Logistics, and Experience",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After visiting family in Southern California over Christmas, and feeling antsy to do something outside after suffering through half of a Northern Utah winter, I made plans to hike the Trans-Catalina Trail from December 28th through 31st. The hike exceeded my expectations, both in terms of scenery and difficulty. It was hard, probably the most challenging of my recent hikes. I also did it in only two nights; most hikers will take at least three and maybe four. Unfortunately, two nights was a necessity because I could not secure reservations at BlackJack Campground (more on that below). My full hike with mileage can be found on CalTopo here.\n\nLogistics\nThe hike presents some semi-challenging logistical issues, mostly because of the boat ride. There are only two places to start the hike on Catalina: Avalon and Two Harbors. Avalon is the southern terminus of the hike, while Two Harbors is on the northern part of the island, though not at the most northern point of our hike. The Catalina Express boat service, which I believe is the only one that serves Two Harbors (at least in the Winter), runs from Long Beach, to Avalon, to Two Harbors, then back to Long Beach. And, this service is infrequent as most boats just run back-and-forth from Avalon, which is a much bigger town and the main tourist destination on the island (there is almost nothing in Two Harbors.) For this reason, I think most hikers begin at Avalon and hike to Two Harbors, then take the boat back to Long Beach.\nI did not want to do this because I planned on spending two days, including New Years Eve, in Avalon, at the end of the hike. As an aside, Avalon is kind of a weird place. As a native of Southern California, I have been going there since I was a child, and it has not changed at all–at least as far as I can tell–in the last thirty years. I have always liked Catalina and I have a lot of fond memories of Avalon, but it is full of the same bars, restaurants, tourist shops, and golf carts that I remember from 1992. It’s refreshingly resistant to gentrification, upscale restaurants or hotels, but as an adult I would also appreciate the ability to have a nice meal in town. I’m still waiting for that to happen. But, if for no other reason than nostalgia, I was excited to spend New Years Eve in Avalon.\nThere are advantages and problems with hiking both north to south and south to north. The main problem with our plan (north to south with two nights in an Avalon hotel) is that we had to carry town clothes in our backpack. Ultralight people cover your eyes, but this meant I backpacked with jeans, clean shirts, and casual shoes so I had something to wear in Avalon when we finished. This can be avoided two ways. First, spend a night in Avalon and store one’s stuff at the hotel or whatever. But, this is very inefficient and time consuming. I think there is a second way, however. As mentioned, the Catalina Express stops in Avalon before it continues to Two Harbors. There are lockers at the dock in Avalon, and I think one could disembark the boat, store clothes and shoes in the lockers, then re-board the boat. You are definitely not supposed to do this, but I suspect if you asked the crew if you could leave the boat and return, they would let you. If not, I don’t see why you couldn’t just buy a ticket to Two Harbors at the ticket window on the Avalon dock, and re-board. Time is not an issue as the boat sits at the Avalon dock for 15 or 20 minutes, at least. I think in the worst case scenario, you could disembark, get a locker, buy a ticket to Two Harbors, and be back on the boat in about five minutes as everything (i.e., the lockers, ticket window) are within about 50 feet of the boat. I did not do this, but I think it would work (caveat emptor). Or, you could just carry your clothes as I did.\nThe main disadvantage to hiking south to north is that both the prevailing wind and the sun are directly in your face all day, at least in the winter, though I am almost certain this issue would be worse in the summer (do NOT do this hike in the summer, see below). A smaller issue is that because there is very little infrastructure in Two Harbors, it’s almost certain you’d be catching a boat back to Long Beach directly from your hike, meaning you have to stay on schedule, then boat back to Long Beach and drive back to wherever you are spending the night, which in Southern California probably means sitting in traffic after a day of hiking and a boat ride. For these reasons I think it’s just nicer to end in Avalon, get a hotel, take a shower, have a (mediocre) dinner at a restaurant, and catch the boat the next day.\nI am very prone to sea sickness–it’s such a thing for me that it changes my behavior and leads me to avoid boats unless absolutely necessary. I was extremely nervous the night before because large swells were forecast but it really wasn’t that bad, which is normal for the crossing between Long Beach and Avalon. I took Dramamine and sat outside on the boat, but I didn’t have much to worry about. I didn’t notice any effects on my hiking after taking Dramaine either, though once we made camp I fell asleep pretty early. I have been on trips to Catalina in which the boat turned into a vomit comet, but that is exceedingly rare. Once you make it to Avalon, my impression is the ride to Two Harbors is easier because the boat stays relatively close to shore and it seems shorter, at least to me. Sitting outside on the boat also gave me a great view of the numerous dolphins swimming around the boat.\n\n\nDay 1: Two Harbors to Parson’s Landing\nWe took the 8:45 am boat from Long Beach to Avalon, then on to Two Harbors, landing at about 10 am. The general store in Two Harbors sells made to order pizzas for the exorbitant price of about $20, but the pizza is actually good and you can eat it for both lunch and dinner (or a trail snack). The pizza feels somewhat obligatory before or after the hike.\n The trail above Two Harbors on the way to Parson’s Landing.\nThere are two routes to Parson’s Landing. The easier, but longer of the two follows the coast and winds its way in and out of the drainages just above the ocean. It is entirely flat and CalTopo measures it at almost exactly 7.5 miles. We chose the more difficult of the two routes, which leads from the town of Two Harbors, crosses the isthmus to the other harbor, then steeply ascends to the ridge. I am not kidding about the steepness. This is more or less a road or double-track, which constitutes the vast majority of hiking on Catalina, and it gains nearly 1,500 feet of elevation in about 2.25 miles. The trail continues to gain elevation after that as well, but it isn’t quite as steep. At this point, the trail follows the spine of the mountains, with excellent views on both side, but especially to the east side of the island.\n Between the waves at Parson’s Landing. Note the picnic bench near the water and the storage box toppled by the waves.\nNearly above Parson’s Landing, the trail drops very steeply into the campground, which is right on the beach. In fact, the day we were there, we had to camp on a small bluff above the beach because a high tide combined with massive waves meant that the actual campground was nearly underwater. It was a spectacular sight.\nThere is bottled water at the campground. The rules are a little bit fuzzy on whether the bottles are for public consumption, but we used them as did everyone else as there was plenty to go around. On the mainland, reservations are required months in advance for pretty crummy state beach campgrounds that are crowded and noisy. Here, it was easy for us to get a campsite on the beach, in a secluded cove, for the week between Christmas and New Years. I feel comfortable saying Parson’s Landing is the best beach camping in Southern California. Total mileage from Two Harbors is slightly less than seven, and after leaving Two Harbors about 11 am, we were at Parson’s about 4:30 pm.\n\n\nDay 2: Parson’s Landing to Little Harbor\nWe took the coast route back to Two Harbors which is flat and offers nice views of the ocean and beach. We saw a lot of dolphins in the surf, foxes on the road, and a few cars as this is the main road that runs between the various camps along the west side of the island. From Two Harbors the trail again climbs steeply to the South, then to the Southeast. The scenery along this stretch of the trail is spectacular, especially on a clear day, which we were lucky to have. I wouldn’t characterize sections of this trail as being exposed necessarily, but the dropoff on both sides is big and cliffy. I don’t particularly like exposure, and it was a little tight, but nothing to get too worked up about.\n The trail between Two Harbors and Little Harbor.\nThis is a long day, nearly 14 miles. Because you backtrack to Two Harbors, I think some people stay the night there, but it’s only halfway and we wanted to hike farther than that. The problem is, after Two Harbors, it’s a big climb, then a little up and down, then way down to the campground. Again, the campground is right on the ocean, in a little harbor (hence the name), surrounded by palm trees. No complaints here about the scenery, though this is a much bigger campground than Parson’s Landing. Some of the sites are set a ways back from the beach and offer more privacy, but are a longer walk from the ocean.\n The ridge is a little narrow, but the views are great.\n\n\nDay 3: Little Harbor to Avalon\nIt was late December and this is the rainy season in Southern California. I knew a storm was coming in, but the forecast wasn’t too bad and I’m certainly used to camping and hiking in the rain. I was surprised how hard it rained on our second night and how windy it was. The good news is that in typical Southern California fashion, the rain blew out as quickly as it blew in. We awoke to scattered clouds, and a few passing showers, but the weather improved throughout the day. I overheard the campers in the site next to us sharing war stories of how windy it was during the night and how hard it was raining. All I could think was bruh, you guys do not know what it means to camp in the wind and rain (a year later and I was still emotionally scared from my O hike).\nThe hike out of Little Harbor was muddy at first, which made things tough. The trail climbs (steeply, obviously) to a mesa, crosses the mesa, then climbs more. There were a lot of buffalo in this area, and at one point we had to drop into a gully to get around a herd that was standing directly on the trail on top of a ridge. The scenery is fine, and gets better once you reach the ridge and begin heading to the airport. For much of the hike immediately before and after the airport, there are nice views of the highest mountains on the island, but it feels much more like an inland hike in Southern California. There are fewer sweeping views of the ocean but the trail goes through interesting oak and brush habitat, especially after the airport.\n Skylined buffalo blocking the trail.\nThe trail is really up and down in this section, and I was definitely feeling it. We had planned to go all the to Avalon, though the vast majority of people stop at BlackJack Campground, about 8.25 miles from Little Harbor. It is probably a good idea to stop here; the campground is fine, it’s at the top of a little canyon, there is some shade, but there are no views. Our problem was that we couldn’t get a reservation here. I think a lot of people hike up from Avalon and spend the night here. Why they do this, I have no idea because there aren’t any views to speak of, and the hike from the campground to Avalon is probably the least scenic part of the trail. If you want to do a small section, take the boat to Two Harbors and hike to Parsons Landing or Two Harbors.\n After the storm, looking west on the trail toward Long Beach. This is between Little Harbor and the airport\nWe had no choice but to continue, and after BlackJack the trail descends through the canyon. It’s all up and down again from here to the road into Avalon. It’s a bit of a slog as the trail is mostly inland, it’s close to the road and there are tour jeeps and other maintenance vehicles that go by. From about mile ten on, the trail basically parallels the road. Perhaps a good reason to hike south to north is that you get this boring part out of the way first.\nThe trail converges with the road on the ridge directly south of Avalon. The official route actually continues on the road, creating a semi-circle on the ridge around Avalon, dropping into town nearly due east of it. That would have added another two or three miles to our hike and we were exhausted and running out of light, so we just walked down Stage Road. The total mileage from Little Harbor is about 17, though the local sheriff gave us a ride the last two miles or so down Stage Road.\n\n\nOther Information\nI mean this sincerely, I would not do this hike in the Summer. Even in the middle of Winter, the highs were in the mid 60s and that was plenty warm. It’s a strenuous hike, there isn’t much water on the trail, and there is barely a lick of shade along the entire trail (see the pictures). If it is in the mid 70s, I think you’d be cooking all day long. In fact, the sheriff told us that they rescue people from the trail all Summer.\nWe did not have a trail map, and one is probably not necessary, though there are enough crisscrossing roads and trails that it might be useful. The trail is mostly well-signed, and the worst case scenario is that you take a slightly different road or path somewhere. Otherwise, just pay attention and be aware of what direction you’re supposed to go. A few times we started down a side trail or road then realized we weren’t going the right direction.\nOne thing that also surprised us, especially on the last day, was the shortness of the days. We are not used to hiking in the Winter, but we nearly ran out of light on the 17 mile day.\nI saw Rickey Henderson at a breakfast restaurant in Avalon on December 31st.\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "On Hunting",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I am new to hunting, having only began a few years ago, well into middle age. This is unusual–most American men (and it’s almost exclusively men) learn from their fathers and begin hunting at a young age. This dynamic is integral to the hunting ``culture”, which is very real and very toxic. It’s toxic because of the political implications, and all the other cultural trappings of modern American rural, conservative culture: Trump, guns, religion, masculinity and any other social issue one can think of. Hunting culture is one part of a larger in-group/out-group dynamic tgat pits ruralness and urbanness against each other. The joy of conservative hunting men on message boards trying to overcome their cognitive dissonance of elected Republican officials trying to sell off public land to the highest bidder (usually an oil, gas, mining, or logging interest) while justifying their vote for these same officials is almost too perfect.\nThe cultural attachments to hunting do a disservice to the concept of hunting, and make it almost impossible for individuals not steeped in this culture to understand it or to engage with it. Perhaps this is a feature, not a bug: hunters get to play the victim, an absolute pillar of modern conservativism, while also ensuring that crowds remain low and hunting does not become gentrified in the same way fly fishing has become. By playing the victim, I mean they get to complain that non-hunters (liberals) just don’t understand and that they persecute hunters over a wholly scientific, healthy, and environmentally beneficial activity.\nI did not grow up in this culture and I certainly do not subscribe to the cultural and political trappings associated with hunting. But I realized very quickly that I love to hunt. But enjoying it is not enough. People enjoy many things that morally repugnant, but that does not justify their behavior. So there are two components to my thoughts about hunting: 1) is it morally acceptable to hunt? and 2) if yes, why is it enjoyable?\nI am not a philosopher, but I do have training in ``how to think,” for lack of a better term through advanced education and my day job as an academic who writes in formal, technical language. The question of how to define a morally acceptable consumption activity is difficult because individual apply different standards to different activities. For example, I drive a small gas powered truck that gets about 20 miles to the gallon. I find the enormous trucks I’m surrounded by in rural American morally problematic both because of their effect on the environment and how dangerous they are to other drivers. But, this is an arbitrary line I have drawn, which we all do in our daily life. Here is how I think about hunting in terms of morality–for myself–which is the best I can do.\nThe more I think about eating meat in this country the more difficult it becomes to justify. It is one of those things that most people do not grapple with on a daily basis because it is difficult to think about, and when one does think hard about it, it becomes increasingly clear that modern meat production in this country is deeply problematic. Tremendous harm is imposed on animals, which live in what most of us consider inhumane conditions. During the pandemic, there were news stories about the harm imposed on workers in the meat industry, including stories that supervisors took bets on how many of their workers would die from COVID. A huge percentage of workers in the meat-packing industry are non-English speakers, immigrants (both legal and not), and are easily exploited. Forget the animals, the humans are also treated horribly.\nThe book, ``The Omnivore’s Dilemma” makes this point much better than I can, over the course of an entire book, but it is difficult to carefully think about commercial meat in this country and not come to the conclusion that a morally whole and conscious person should not be eating much commercial meat. Some people are able to stop eating any animal products altogether, or become a vegetarian, pescatarian, or the like. It is harder to justify to these people, though still possible, because they have dramatically changed their behavior in an altruistic way. For most of us though, this is extremely hard. Meat tastes good, it is interesting, it makes for a more joyful life. The absolutists will reject this because they know right from wrong, and eating meat is wrong. But again, no one is perfect. A vegan might not eat meat, but may commute 50 miles each way to work in a gas-guzzling car, whereas I eat meat but ride my bike to work. It’s simply impossibly to do the absolute correct thing in our daily lives.\nThe morally responsible among us might do the most obvious thing and make changes at the margins. Meatless Mondays or example, or take other steps to reduce their overall consumption. And these steps are good! It is very difficult to simply stop eating meat, but very easy to not eat meat one day a week, and the aggregate effects of these individual behavior changes are substantial. A logical next step then, is to replace commercial, factory farmed or inhumane meat with wild meat. Enter hunting.\nThere are a few common objections: the animals suffer, most people are trophy hunters only, it causes animals to become rarer or threatens extinction. Each of these can be easily addressed. Animals killed will suffer, hopefully briefly, just as anything suffers as it dies. But compared to animals living on feed lots of factory farms, the suffering must be much less, on average. Occasionally a hunter will miss a shot and hit an animal in a way that causes it to die over a few days, but commercial meat production results in collective animal suffering on a daily basis that dwarfs any suffering that occurs from a hunter’s bullet or arrow. And of course, the way animals meet their end in the wild as a result of their environment is rarely pretty. Most ungulates (deer, elk, moose) starve to death over the course of a few months.\nMost hunters do prize bigger antlers as trophies, but hunters harvest the meat from all animals they kill in this country. It is the law. It is illegal to ``waste meat” and even if a hunter wants to shoot a large moose for example, they are required to save the meat. It is also the case that nearly all hunters value the meat for both cultural and culinary reasons. That is, the idea that hunters in this country shoot an animal for it’s antlers and leave the carcass is simply wrong. It does not happen except in very rare–and illegal–circumstances.\nThe last objection easy to deal with: hunting reduces animal populations. This is probably true, but the quantity of hunting licenses and tags (a tag is essentially a permit to shoot a specific animal) are determined by political and bureaucratic bodies which rely on scientific evidence. In this country, states regulation hunting, and states employ biologists who help determine license and tag policy. Is it perfect? No, just as any political outcome is not perfect; it does not lie at my ideal point or your ideal point. The policies are not exactly what I would set if I were in charge, but that is true for nearly every law ever created. An important principle people do not understand about politics is that the policies produced are the result of an aggregation of preferences, and just because a policy is not exactly what you want does not make it wrong or immoral. I struggle with predator hunting (that is, hunting animals like mountain lions or wolves). In my opinion, the science suggests the populations of these animals are declining and that states should greatly reduce the number of tags distributed for these (depending on the state). But there is absolutely zero chance hunting drives mountain lions or wolves to extinction. As far as the most commonly hunted mammals in the United States–deer and elk–all scientific evidence suggests that hunting has almost no negative effects on their populations. The deer population is in long-term decline in the West (though not in the East), but that is due to climate change, loss of habitat, and forest management practices, not hunting. Elk populations are too high in many places and hunting is needed to control them. (Elk numbers are increasing because they are less sensitive to extreme weather events and loss of habitat, and there are fewer predators to reduce their numbers in most western states).\nSetting aside the moral objection that killing any animals is always wrong (which is a standard most of us would fail given our food, clothes, bug spray, etc.), all other moral claims fall away. There are positive moral arguments as well. The claims collapse to an objection about hunting culture, and more broadly, the politics associated with it. I too find the politics objectionable, but this has nothing to do with hunting and everything to do with modern political polarization and culture. Other cultural identifiers are wrapped up in this. Hunters use guns and guns, along with gun companies and the NRA are morally bankrupt. I agree with this, and while I own guns, I also believe in gun control."

    "text": "Plan of Attack to Complete the California Heritage Trout Challenge\nIn the Winter of 2023, I sketched out a backpacking trip into the Sierra for the three Golden Trout species, then I’d add on two additional fish (I’d already caught one, the Lahontan Cutthroat, in 2022). A huge snow year prevented that from happening when I had time for a vaction, in the second week of July. Instead, I completed my California Heritage Trout Challenge (HTC) in the summer of 2023 after catching the remaining five on a long road trip in July of 2023. Even though I previously caught Coastal Rainbows, Kern River Rainbows, and Golden Trout as a child, I treated the challenge as a fresh start.\nI’d like to catch the four additional fish to work toward the Master Angler title. If I catch the three Golden Trout, along with the Eagle Lake Rainbow, which I also haven’t managed to catch (and I can’t blame the snow for my failure) I’ll look into whether it’s even possible to catch a Pauite downstream of the closure. In other words, I’d like to complete the Master Angler level, but I’ll save solving the problem of the Pauite for later.\nBelow, I describe each of the fish I caught, starting with the Lahontan in 2022, then discussing five additional fish caught in 2023. I also want to mention that the website Keep Calm and Fly Fish was an invaluable resource for my trip.\n\nLahontan Cutthroat–Upper Truckee River\nThe Upper Truckee headwaters are in Meiss Meadows just over a pass from Highway 88 outside of Tahoe. It was a strange experience returning here as I did a backpacking trip to this same area with my father as a teenager in 1998. On that trip, we tried to reach Showers Lake by hiking south from Highway 50. It was a big snow year and we quickly realized we couldn’t make it, so we drove to 88 and tried to hike north. We were again blocked by snow, and decided to backtrack to Meiss Lake and camp there. It was genuinely shocking to see how much smaller the lake was in 2022 as compared to 1998.\nMeiss Meadow is a lovely area that’s an easy day hike from Highway 88. Once over the pass and down into the meadows, the trail crosses the headwaters of the Truckee, but the river here is a little indistinct as it braids through the grass and picks up water from Meiss Lake and a number of small ponds. I hiked past the river crossing, then ventured off trail to a point where I thought the river would be more defined and larger. It was still fairly small and somewhat brushy, but there were lots of holes to cast into, and I could immediately see a lot of fish.\n The old Meiss Ranch.\nIt didn’t take long to catch a few Lahontans on a generic parachute mayfly imitation, and my first qualifying fish for the California Heritage Trout Challenge was in the books. It was disconcerting to see how low the water was, especially because it was only mid-July, not that late in the season. It was also disconcerting to see damage from the Caldor Fire at various points along Highway 88 up the canyon coming from the west. I’m glad the significant rain and snowfall in the 2022-2023 season will solve some of the water problems in the Sierra, at least temporarily.\n Very low water on the Upper Truckee in mid-July, 2022. Caught a deer unawares.\n\n\nEagle Lake Rainbow Trout–Attempt Number 1, Eagle Lake\nHave I mentioned how much I hate fishing giant lakes? I went to Eagle Lake about six weeks after not catching anything at Pyramid Lake, and caught…exactly nothing at Eagle Lake. Without a boat, it felt impossible, and in fact, I did not see single person catch a fish from shore. I asked my campground neighbor, an Eagle Lake regular, what I was doing wrong. He said it was the first time he could remember getting skunked. The fish didn’t cooperate, the weather didn’t cooperate, and my bad fishing luck has now extended to a third straight trip. After Eagle lake, I needed a win, and soon.\nI fished Eagle Lake on the opener, Memorial Day weekend. I was worried this would make the lake and campgrounds a crowded mess, but it was surprisingly calm. On Saturday, there were probably about 20-30 boats on the lake, but it’s big enough that the scene didn’t feel chaotic. We stayed at Aspen Grove campground which is tents-only, with sites spread out among pine trees. The sites are just about far enough apart to offer some privacy, and the farther one walks back from the parking lot, the nicer the spots, along with less trafficked bathrooms. Most surprisingly, the campground did not fill up on Memorial Day weekend, though it looked like the RV campground was crowded, if not full. There are a few additional campgrounds as one drives around the lake, clockwise. The two BLM campgrounds in the north-west corner of the lake looked nice and were nearly deserted, but they are farther away from the lake shore and in the very shallow north basin, where the fishing is supposed to be worse (if that is even possible).\nFrom Aspen Glen, it’s an easy walk either down the road or along the shore to the eastern shoreline where the wade anglers congregated (and the boats trolled, almost within casting distance of the shore). The eastern shoreline has some rocks and structure, and appears to drop into deeper water more quickly as compared to the area immediately in front of Aspen Glen which is a sandy beach with a low gradient, making it difficult to get your fly into deep water. On the eastern side, there are a few obvious points that stick out into the water, and for most of the first day at least one angler was standing on these points, though again, not a single person caught a fish that I saw.\n An incoming storm.\n One of the points on the eastern shore where anglers congregated.\nI tried the eastern side for most of opening morning, but thunderstorms cut short my fishing. About 10 or 11 a.m. the storms started rolling in, and I took shelter from off-and-on lightning, heavy rain, and hail. I’m no boating expert, but I don’t think it’s smart to stay out on a giant lake in a lightning storm, as I saw a number of people do. Eventually, after fighting the weather for much of the morning and early afternoon, I headed back to camp about 2 p.m. I fished in the same spots in the evening, with no action. The next day I drove around to the Christie area, then up to Pine Creek, which was flowing pretty good. I talked to a guy loading up his car at Christie and he said no one was catching fish there. So much for that.\nThat evening I drove all the way around the lake from Aspen Glen to the Lassen Youth Camp, which takes about an hour from either direction (i.e., traveling clockwise around the lake, or going counterclockwise, back out to Susanville then north up the lake.) This spot is recommended by Eaglelakefishing.net, the authoritative website on Eagle Lake. Coincidentally, before I left for my trip, I received an email from an accomplished angler asking about my Nevada slam. We exchanged tips and I mentioned I was headed to Eagle Lake. He said that this trout is arguably the most difficult to catch in California if one doesn’t have a boat, but he managed to catch his near the Youth Camp.\nTo reach the area, take Merrillville Road off 139. Driving clockwise, Google Maps lists a different exit, but that’s clearly not correct. From Merrillville Road, it’s a bit confusing, but there are signs at every junction. Be aware that it is a long drive on dirt roads, but high clearance and/or four-wheel drive is not necessary if the roads are dry. The water off the Youth Camp looks like a very fishy spot. It appears to get deep very quickly, and there are large rocks that provide structure. There were a few other people also fishing there, but there was plenty of space to spread out. I fished for about an hour until another storm blew in and I had to retreat to my car. Also nearby is the Chico State biology station, but a lot of the shoreline near the station was signed as private property, and what wasn’t signed appeared to be a shallow beach area that didn’t look that promising–the Youth Camp is the spot.\n Fishing near the Youth Camp before another storm rolled in.\nDespite the good looking water, I had as much success on that side of the lake as I had near Aspen Glen. After two and a half solid days of fishing, I didn’t manage so much as a nibble. Eaglelakefishing.net reported that shore fishing was bad all over the lake on opening weekend. If I go back, I might disperse camp near the Youth Camp and fish exclusively in that area for a day or two.\nI considered fishing Pine Creek, Eagle Lake’s main tributary. The creek near the lake is closed to fishing, a change apparently made in the last year or two because the California regulations book from 2021-2022 says Pine Creek is open during the same season as Eagle Lake. The 23-24 book says Pine Creek is open only above Highway 44, which is about 25 miles upstream of Eagle Lake. From what I could find online, there might be a stream resident population of ELRT in the perennial section of Pine Creek near Bogard Campground. The stream is also full of brook trout, however, and I’ve played this game before (see my attempts to catch a Colorado River Cutthroat in Wyoming). Despite my hesitation, later in the summer I stayed at Bogard to fish Pine Creek above Highway 44 (description below).\nThe problem with fishing Eagle Lake in the heart of Summer is that when the water warms up, the trout head deep, making it nearly impossible to catch them from shore. That means either coming back in the Fall or next Spring, but I’m just not convinced shore fishing is a good strategy. I have also considered hiring a guide with a boat if I get desperate. I don’t love the idea though, both because of the cost and because it feels a little icky. The spirit of the challenge is to solve the problem of catching different fish in different drainages, not hire someone to do it (mostly) for you. Without a boat though, I just don’t think success from shore is very likely.\n\n\nCoastal Cutthroat Trout–Little Jones Creek\nUpdate, Fall 2023: Sadly, the Little Jones Creek watershed was burned about six weeks after my visit in the Smith River Complex fire.\nThis was the first fish I targeted on a week-long roadtrip throughout California in July 2023. I drove from the Bay Area, to Del Norte County, east to the McCloud River area, up to Modoc County, then down to the Eagle Lake area, again. The size of California never ceases to amaze me as I covered over 1,500 miles on this trip while successfully catching all five fish I targeted. I can’t say the fishing was great, but that’s not really the point of these challenges. I also fished two different rivers that were not part of the challenge; I’ve put details on those rivers under a separate header here.\nReports online suggest that the Coastal Cutthroat is one of the more challenging fish to catch in the HTC. Descriptions abound of people catching hundreds of coastal rainbows before connecting on a cutthroat. The usual suggestions are Hurdygurdy Creek, Mill Creek, the Smith River, or Patrick Creek. Luckily, I received some good beta before I left about exactly where to fish: Little Jones Creek. From what I can gather, the creek has only native Coastals in it, and there are falls at the confluence of the creek and the Middle Fork of the Smith River that prevent encroachment from Rainbows. In fact, this fish was the easiest of the challenge for me, and may have been my favorite overall experience.\nI stayed at Patrick Creek Campground, which is just around the corner from Little Jones Creek road. I arrived on Sunday night and surprisingly, there were only about two sites available. I also checked on Panther Flat and Grassy Flat, which also had only a few open sites. Panther Flat is by far the biggest campground in the area and it looked a bit crowded and noisy, but it was also the farthest away from the highway. Grassy Flat and Patrick Creek are much smaller, but closer to the road. The sites in each looked about the same, nicely spread apart with some privacy, and preferable to Panther Flat. In the end, I chose Patrick Creek because it is right on the Middle Fork of the Smith and is the closest to Little Jones Creek, but there is a significant amount of road noise. It also cost $14 a night, which is medium-high by forest service campground standards, but seriously, who has $14 in cash in this day and age? I ended up paying $20 the first night, then driving down the road to a store, buying ice to make change, and paying exactly $14 dollars the second night. Come on USFS, figure out a cashless payment system.\n Taken from my campsite. The road is directly behind the trees near the yellow sign.\nDriving east from the campgrounds, the road to Little Jones Creek is signed at its intersection with Highway 199. The road is paved until its intersection with the forest road that drops off into the Little Jones basin on the right. From here it’s a good forest service road, though I’ve heard it can become a little dicey when wet. Both the forest service road into the basin and the paved road to the top of the ridge are very steep, but passenger cars should not have an issue.\nThe drive from the highway to the creek is quick, 20 minutes or so. There is an obvious parking spot on the left, and I initially took the road a little farther into the drainage just to investigate as I usually try to avoid parking and fishing at the first obvious spot. There is private land along the creek and a little farther up the forest road is a driveway that is clearly signed and has a fancy camera pointing at its intersection with the public land. The whole thing looked a little sketchy so the private land should be avoided. After the first point where the road meets the creek, it gains elevation and while it was possible to reach the creek with a steep hike down the road, the private land also extends up the creek a ways making access somewhat limited. In other words, it’s probably not necessary to keep driving once one reaches the point where the parking area is after first entering the drainage.\nAfter going a little farther up the forest service road, I drove back the way I came, parked and started fishing, working my way upstream to the private land (though I was careful not to cross onto the private given the weird signs and camera on the forest road). As is typical for me on this type of creek, I used a dry dropper with a generic size 14 mayfly and size 16 prince nymph. The fishing was easy, and I hammered 10 or 15 fish within an hour, most on the dry. I felt a little guilty about how easy it was given how much difficulty others reported trying to catch a Coastal. The stream is small and I used my Daiwa Keiryu-X 24 tenkara rod, which is eight feet long, just about perfect for streams of this size. The fish were small but spectacularly colored and spotted, looking very different from other cutthroats I’ve caught. And, it’s such a unique experience fishing in the greenery and lushness of the Northern California coastal area. While the fishing wasn’t among the redwoods per se, it was close enough.\n The largest Coastal Cutthroat I caught, but an absolutely striking fish.\n Little Jones Creek.\n\n\nCoastal Rainbow Trout–Middle Fork Smith River\nI was planning on staying at the campground for two nights and with the extra time on my hands, I fished the Middle Fork of the Smith River directly below Patrick Creek Campground. It’s easy to access from the campground either from the sites themselves, where the river is down a steep embankment, or via the parking area slightly east of the camping area. The river looks good in this area; though it’s a little short of structure it’s plenty deep and wide, and the opposite bank had some nice overhangs.\nI won’t spend too much time discussing how to catch the Coastal Rainbow as it’s the most common trout in the state, but there are definitely a lot of them in the Middle Fork. The problem is, none were larger than about eight inches. The river certainly seems capable of supporting bigger fish, I just couldn’t find them, even drifting a nymph through deeper looking holes. At the confluence of Patrick Creek and the Middle Fork of the Smith, there is a very deep hole, maybe ten feet or more, that must hold big fish. Still, I don’t like the idea of tying on a giant split shot nymph rig for one hole on a larger river. I didn’t cast into that hole in any meaningful way that allowed me to get deeper than a few feet, but there should be twelve inch fish in other normal sized holes. I just didn’t see any.\n Middle Fork of the Smith River.\nI wasn’t even going to fish the Smith, assuming I’d get my Rainbow at another spot (and indeed I did, in Deer Creek, where the fish were also small), but in retrospect, I’m glad I did. There was almost no information online about fishing the Middle Fork and maybe this is why. If you’re into catching twenty, six inch Rainbow Trout (meaning twenty different fish, not a few 26 inch fish) go for it. As for me, the fishing in the Middle Fork was decidedly meh, but the scenery and river itself were beautiful.\n\n\nMcCloud Redband Trout–Trout Creek\nAfter spending two nights at Patrick Creek Campground I drove up Highway 199, to the 5, then down to the Mt. Shasta area. I really enjoy the scenery in this part of the state as Mt. Shasta is incredibly prominent from almost any vantage point. It’s such an impressive looking mountain, and I think most people don’t expect this type of scenery in California.\n Mt. Shasta, from southeast of the McCloud River basin.\nI stayed at Cattle Camp campground for the simple reason that it was about halfway between where I wanted to fish, on Trout Creek, and a planned fishing expedition to the Lower McCloud. (Because the Lower McCloud was not part of my HTC, I describe it under a separate section.) Cattle Camp is a fairly large campground, one of three on the McCloud River loop, a scenic drive off Highway 89. Fowler’s Campground is the largest, and unlike Cattle Camp, it is located directly on the river. However, I had thoughts of fishing the river and Fowler’s has a lot of people swimming and hanging out down by the river. Algoma is farther down the Highway, and off the McCloud River loop, but it appeared to be too far upstream to allow for good fishing in the McCloud. Though Cattle Camp is not located directly on the river, it’s a very short drive to river access. Based on my scouting, it’s surprisingly difficult to find good river access along the McCloud River loop, aside from the dedicated Forest Service spots. In a lot of places it the river is down a very steep embankment, and there aren’t a ton of places to park. I ended up fishing the McCloud at Camp Four Group Campground one evening, and I was the only person around.\nCattle Camp is a perfectly pleasant Forest Service campground, though like Patrick Creek, when I arrived on a Tuesday I was surprised to find almost all sites had been taken. There are two loops, and I found the loop to the left (when driving into the campground) to have nicer spots, though they are closer to the main highway. Unlike Patrick Creek, Cattle Camp is far enough from the highway that traffic noise can be heard rarely, only when a particularly loud car, truck, or motorcycle passes.\nAny redband caught in the McCloud above the falls counts for the challenge, but serious anglers know that Trout Creek offers the only real chance to catch the most genetically pure strand of McCloud Redband. That’s where I headed the first evening I arrived, about a 45 minute drive from Cattle Creek campground. Based on my research, I assumed catching the fish would be relatively easy, though in retrospect, given how easy the Coastal was, I was due for regression to the mean.\nIt was an absolute struggle to catch fish in Trout Creek, so I’m going to provide a detailed description. There are a number of possible ways to reach Trout Creek down forest service roads, and Google will suggest different routes depending on the direction of travel. I think by far the easiest and fastest is to take the Volcanic Scenic Byway to Forest Road 13. The Volcanic Scenic Byway is a small paved road without line markings, but there are logging trucks and other traffic. After turning onto the forest road, it’s a short and easy drive to the campground, which is off the main forest road but clearly marked. The roads are all in good condition and can be easily driven by passenger cars.\n Trout Creek near the campground. This picture undersells how brushy and difficult it was to fish this area.\nI saw others complaining online about the condition of Trout Creek campground, but it looked nice enough to me. When entering the campground, follow the dirt road until it crosses the creek. There is no reason to drive across the creek, so park under the pines and start fishing. Given the small size of the creek and the brush, I used my tenkara rod with a dry-dropper again (just like on Little Jones Creek). Sometimes in shallow water with lots of brush I’ll skip the dropper; it makes casting and dapping more difficult and I assume the fish will come up for the fly. This is entirely a feel thing rather than any sort of clear strategy and if whatever I’m doing doesn’t work, I’ll switch.\nNear where the road crosses the creek, there is a large obvious hole formed by a stump, and another good looking hole slightly downstream. I didn’t bring anything up in the stump hole, but I did bring up at least one fish in the next hole. I wasn’t able to land it, however. In fact, I brought up five or six fish and couldn’t land any of them! It is extremely brushy in the campground and I had a very hard time making casts and finding fish for three or four hours. It was a lot of bushwacking, bad casts, and swearing. Eventually I worked my way up to a point where the brush diminished and the creek become more of a freestone stream. There were good looking and easily fishable holes in this area, about a half-mile to three-quarters of a mile upstream from the campground. The problem is, I didn’t see any fish in this area and didn’t move a thing. After nearly four hours of this, I gave up and walked down the road that parallels the stream back to my car.\nMy general philosophy is to listen to others’ advice when fishing, even if I think they don’t know what they’re talking about (which is often). When I returned to my car, I was going to try and fish the same holes I started with near my parking spot in hopes of bringing up the same fish I nearly hooked four hours before. As I was preparing to do so, a motorhome pulled up and asked if I could move my truck so they could camp in the spot. My first thought was to say, find your own spot, you should have gotten here four hours earlier. But I resisted the urge and said, “I’m planning on fishing right here, but I’ll move soon and you can have the spot.” The boomer said, “Can you move now so I can pull in?” I was not thrilled and wished the guy would just give me a few minutes, but I didn’t really have anything to be annoyed about. He then asked me how it was going, I told him, and he suggested I move downstream to where it was less brushy.\n Lower down on Trout Creek where I caught my fish.\nTo reach the downstream area, do the following. On the road that enter the campground, there is a cattle grate. Immediately before the grate, there is a small road that goes to the left. Turn here and the road will parallel a barbwire fence on the right, with the creek beyond the fence. The road condition is okay; there is one spot that might require high clearance, but four-wheel drive is definitely not necessary. Maybe half a mile down the road, there is an obvious turnout and a gate on the right that allows access to the land behind the fence. Walk through the gate, follow the small dirt track to the creek and fish upstream or downstream from this point. The creek environment is totally different here, more of a meandering meadow creek with overhanging willows and a sandy bottom, rather than the mud and choking brush in the campground. There are not a lot of fish in this area, but there are clear holes with fish in them. As I went upstream, I saw a fish feeding and cast to it, but got no response before it spooked. I went back downstream and worked that direction. At about seven p.m., I saw a fish rising downstream of me and made a float toward it. After nearly five hours of fishing, I had my McCloud Redband. I wouldn’t want to have to do that again, but if I did I would immediately start in the downstream meadow section rather than at the campground.\n Google Earth image of where I caught my fish relative to Trout Creek Campground.\nMy efforts to fish in the upper McCloud, along the loop road, were short but similarly fruitless. I saw one fish feeding, made a crappy cast, and it disappeared. I didn’t bring up anything else in about an hour of fishing. The McCloud is surprisingly small until it gets closer to the falls, but it’s crowded in that area with people swimming so I didn’t do any fishing down there. I’m also glad I didn’t plan on catching my rainbow here because I didn’t see any of those either. Good scenery, not great fishing.\n Lower, Middle, and Upper McCloud Falls.\n\n\nWarner Lakes Redband Trout–Dismal Creek\nFrom the McCloud area I drove south through the Fall River Valley. In this area, both Lassen and Shasta are visible to the south and northwest respectively, which is a unique perspective on both given their prominence above the surrounding landscape. The drive is easy and otherwise unremarkable. My plan was to fish for the Warner Lakes Redband first, catch it, then return to Lassen Creek Campground and spend the night. If I wasn’t able to catch the Warner Lakes Reband and had to try again in the morning, I could easily stay at Cave Lake Campground near the Dismal Creek basin.\nThe forest road from Highway 395 up to Cave Lake is in good condition but the grade is very steep. The habitat looks more similar to Utah or Nevada than say, the Sierra, which makes sense given the mountains form the western edge of the Great Basin. In 2023, the forest was still exceptionally green and there were still snow patches on the higher peaks, consistent with language in the HTC booklet. In fact, the HTC book warns that, “…snow may be present well into July. Well-shaded forests along the access roads can often leave deep pockets of snow that impede road access. In addition, road conditions are mainly unimproved and high-clearance vehicles are recommended.” I found both warnings a little hyperbolic. I arrived on July 13th in a very heavy snow year and the forest roads to Dismal Creek basin were completely dry. As I mentioned, the road to Cave Lake was good, and the road above Cave Lake to the Dismal Creek basin road turnoff was also in fairly good share, if a little hair-raising as it hugs some cliffs above the lake. From the turnoff into the Dismal Creek basin the road is probably fine for cars with a little bit of clearance as there are just a few rocky sections and some small dry rivulets running down the road. The turnoff to Dismal Creek is signed, making it impossible to miss.\nThe drive into the basin crosses a low pass and drops slightly into a large meadow with some cliff bands above and to the right. The creek begins in these meadows and gathers water as it flows downstream, nearly due north into Oregon. The area is very striking and was probably my favorite scenery of the entire trip. It helps that there was no one else up there except one dirt biker who went past on the road.\n The meadow where Dismal Creek begins.\nOnce the road emerges from the pines and enters the meadow, it crosses the creek then continues semi-parallel to it for another mile or so. Immediately before the creek crossing, there is a big obvious turnoff near some rocks. I parked here and made my way down to the creek, deciding to work upstream before I fished an obvious hole on the downstream side of the road culvert. The creek is small, only a foot or two wide, but it is somewhat deep and looked like it could hold trout. I am always suspicious of the obvious hole on the side of the road, so I usually like to work upstream before returning, thinking that if things go wrong, I’ll still have the obvious spot to fall back on. Access on Dismal Creek is a non-issue and though the willows are thick in spots approaching the creek, there wasn’t much overhang which made casting easy with my Tenkara.\nI again used a dry-dropper, and I thought the dropper would especially useful given the significant depth (knee deep in parts) relative to width. I floated my flies very close to some undercut banks, and through some deeper holes. Five minutes went by without action, then ten, then fifteen. I don’t actually expect to catch a fish in ten or fifteen minutes, but something should happen: a rise, a take, a nibble, a fish spooking. I didn’t see a thing. I’ll sometimes walk through water or stomp on the bank just to move a fish, and I did that on Dismal Creek after about 20 minutes of nothing.\nI walked back to the obvious hole on the side of the road. I gave myself a little space downstream, then worked up to it, again having no problems making good casts or getting my flies where I wanted them. I got to the deep hole immediately downstream of the culvert and cast my flies in a few times. Absolutely no movement. At this point, I’d fish for about a half hour and hadn’t seen a thing. I became convinced there weren’t fish in this part of the creek. Time to change plans.\nI had Twelvemile Creek as a backup, but it looked much farther down the road and I didn’t want to drive that far down the forest road unless I absolutely had to. Dismal Creek flows through the first meadow, then appears to drop steeply down into a second flat-ish, meadow-like area. I decided to drive another half-mile or so down the road where it looked like access to the lower meadow was easier. onX suggests that a number of smaller springs and side channels contribute water to Dismal Creek in the second, lower meadow, so I was hoping that bigger water would hold fish. Driving down the road, there is a rock-covered knob to the left, then a small canyon to the right of the knob. I parked there and worked my way down the canyon and knob, which proved to be a little tricky because of significant blow-down in the pines on the knob, and thick willows in the canyon. Still, reaching Dismal Creek in the lower meadow wasn’t all that far of a hike, about 20 minutes down, though one loses significant elevation so it’s a longer hike back up. Google Earth shows a very large pond in almost exactly the spot where I fished. That pond is no longer there, but the creek is somewhat bigger than in the upper meadow and there was at least one small beaver pond (though nothing like the size of the one shown on Google Earth). As I walked up to the creek, I immediately saw a spooked fish swim upstream. Found them, finally!\n Lower down, Dismal Creek looked fishy.\n Google Earth image of where I caught my fish in the Dismal Creek drainage.\n The fish I caught was rising at the front of this hole under the branches.\nI walked downstream on the banks, then found a break in the willows and started working my way upstream in the creek, casting as I went. There were good looking holes in this area, and I quickly found that some of them held fish, though I would expect greater fish density given the look of the water. I brought up a few fish on my dry, but was unable to hook any of them. Still, at this point it felt like catching one was only a matter of time. Of course, I had thought that at Trout Creek too. My first and only Warner Lake Redband brought to the net took about two hours total, including fishing in the upper meadow for maybe 30 minutes, driving to the second spot, hiking 20 minutes down into the lower meadow, then fishing for another 30 to 40 minutes. I probably could have caught more Warner Lakes had I wanted to, but I still needed to drive over to Lassen Creek, set up camp there and maybe even fish that evening.\n Looking down the Dismal Creek drainage into Oregon. This was my favorite spot on the entire trip.\n\n\nGoose Lake Redband Trout–Lassen Creek\nLassen Creek Campground is free, and that’s the best thing I have to say about it. Reviews online suggest it’s very nice, but I was extremely disappointed. First, because I showed up late in the afternoon, around 5 p.m., there were only two sites available. One was set apart from the other sites, but didn’t have much shade and was right next to the bathrooms. The other site was on the creek, but was sandwiched between two other sites with virtually no privacy. As I was putting my tent up, the dog from one of the sites ran over to me and started jumping up on myself and the tent–not cool at all. Luckily, the people in the site very close to me stayed inside their trailer the entire time I was there. The campground is only seven sites–two are isolated and looked nice, but had large groups of people in them. One is isolated right next to the bathroom, and the other four are nearly on top of each other. It’s also stuck between two forest service roads that had trucks driving up and down them frequently, including large logging trucks. Road noise wasn’t as bad as at Patrick Creek, but for being in the middle of nowhere there was a decent amount of activity.\n My tent and my neighbor’s trailer at Lassen Creek. Not a lot of space or privacy between sites.\nAnd there were cows, the nemesis of small creek anglers. When I arrived, I noticed the creek was somewhat off-color, and it took me about an hour to figure out why. Cows were above, below, and in the campground. My camping spot had a large pie right in the middle of it. When I fished the next morning, a group of ranchers drove 30 cows or so up the road immediately to my right and into meadows above the campground. Were I to do this again, I would reverse the order of my fishing, stopping at Lassen Creek first, then driving to Cave Lake and camping there, fishing Dismal Creek the next morning. It also looked possible to disperse camp near the Dismal Creek basin, making that an attractive option. The drive between Cave Lake and Dismal Creek isn’t far, but it’s just enough of a pain to make it worthwhile to camp in the basin itself.\nAt Lassen Creek, there were fishy looking holes right at my campsite. Even though I told myself I wanted to wait until the morning for an official go at finishing my slam, I couldn’t resist and threw my dry-dropper into the holes while holding a beer. I brought fish up immediately though I didn’t successfully hook any; completing the slam would have to wait until morning. When I woke up, I walked downstream to where the road crosses a bridge on its way to the campground and started fishing. Lassen Creek has moderate brush, but there are enough clear spots to make some good casts. I started catching fish almost immediately and brought five or six to the net within an hour. Officially, my slam was complete.\n The creek right behind my campsite. These holes held fish but the water was hazy because of the cows upstream.\n\n\nEagle Lake Rainbow Trout–Attempt Number 2, Pine Creek near Bogard Campground\nI had budgeted approximately eight nights and I’d only used five to finish my HTC. I had a few ideas about what to do next. Fishing Hat Creek near Burney intrigued me as it’s touted as one of the best fly-fishing destinations in the state and was only about two hours away. I also thought about driving to Reno and fishing the Truckee for a whitefish, which would put me one fish closer to finishing the Nevada slam. I’d struck out earlier in the summer on Eagle Lake so I had the idea of fishing Pine Creek above Highway 44, near Bogard Campground. As discussed above, I had no idea if there were even Eagle Lake Rainbows in the creek, but I thought the worst that could happen is I catch a bunch of Brook Trout. A significant heatwave was setting in and the high temperature the next day in Reno was forecast to be 106. Even if I was standing in the Truckee, that sounded miserable. Hat Creek would always be there and I was a little wary about trying to fight the crowds on a Friday and Saturday. And, even though I had officially finished my HTC, my goal was always to catch all the possible fish in California, not just six. Exploring Pine Creek might get me one fish closer, solve the problem of how to catch the Eagle Lake Rainbow trout without fishing the lake, and answer a question about the fish in the creek. The allure of catching a seventh Heritage Trout was too much, so on to Bogard Campground I went.\nWhen I left Lassen Creek about 10 a.m., it was already roasting. When I arrived at Bogard Campground three hours later, it was downright suffocating. The campground is nice enough with sites set among pine trees and somewhat spaced out. As with every other campground I visited, there were only two or three sites available out of ten total. I spent my first three hours there seeking shade and trying to wait out the heat. It is far enough away from the highway that there was no road noise, but there is an active train track that parallels the main road and the conductors really seemed to lay on their horns. I’m a deep sleeper and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a freight train horn.\nAbout 5 p.m. I decided to give it a go. Near camping site three(?) there is a sign pointing to the water pump. From there, the creek is straight ahead through tall grass, brush, and swamp. I was surprised how large it was and how many good looking holes there were, so I expected to catch a bunch of brook trout, at least. There were three problems with fishing Pine Creek near the campground. First, reaching it from the campground is not that easy. The brush and grass is quite thick and it’s hard to see where you’re stepping and where you’re going. Second, once at the creek, there are a tremendous number of logjams that block upstream and downstream access, though there seemed to be fewer of them moving downstream. The logjams can be navigated by going around them, but that involves some serious bushwhacking. They are really a pain and block a substantial amount of creek access. The campground and creek are on the edge of the 2021 Dixie Fire burn scar and while the campground appears to be largely unscathed, there are a significant number of downed trees to the north, closer to the creek area. The amount of water required to move those logs and dirt is hard to imagine.\nThe third problem I faced fishing Pine Creek is that there weren’t any fish. I have no idea where they were. My research seemed to imply that both Pine Creek and nearby Bogard Creek were infested with Brook trout and possibly some Eagle Lake Rainbows, but it’s obvious there was nothing in the creek near the campground. I moved upstream some distance, through a higher gradient section, then into the upper meadow above the campground. The creek was definitely big enough to hold fish, and had some nice looking holes, but it was entirely empty. I have no idea and I’d love to know what’s going on with Pine Creek in that area. I assume the fish are up higher, but I can’t imagine the area around the campground is not good enough habitat. If anyone else is thinking about trying to fish for the Eagle Lake Rainbow near Bogard, my advice is don’t do it. I have no pictures from Bogard either; it was hot, and I was tired and frustrated.\n\n\nSummary\nI was able to catch five fish in six nights, but as with the Wyoming slam, I felt this was a little too quick to move through the challenge. On the other hand, all of the creeks, with the exception of the Middle Fork of the Smith River, are very small and don’t offer classically great fly fishing unless you’re really excited by four inch fish. In that sense, the HTC is more like the Utah Cutthroat Slam in that the water and fish are both on the small side. None of the spots were places I wanted to spend two or three nights fishing nonstop. In fact, after my second night fishing the Smith and feeling less than satisfied I had terrifying thoughts: was this all becoming rote? Would I better off going to someplace in Montana and hammering 18 inch fish on the regular? Do those places even exist? Why am I wandering so far afield from the Logan River when that’s just about the best fishing I’ve ever experienced?\nI think these thoughts mostly disappeared as the trip continued, but let’s just say I haven’t totally dismissed them. Fishing for, and catching the Coastal Cutthroat and Warner Lakes were enjoyable experiences. I also have not caught any of the Kern Rainbows and I’m hoping the Kern River offers better overall fishing. As an aside, I don’t know what to say about the Eagle Lake Rainbow Trout. I hate fishing lakes, but I’ll probably catch it someday?\nIn terms of difficulty, six fish is definitely harder than the four required in Utah and Wyoming, but the fishing, on the whole, was somewhat easy. The McCloud River Redband from Trout Creek was by far the most difficult for me, but I was able to catch every fish within a few hours. The scenery and campgrounds were nice enough, and I particularly enjoyed the Shasta/McCloud area, even if the fishing wasn’t great. The challenge also allowed me to see parts of the state I would never otherwise end up in (Modoc County, for example). In fact, the Dismal Creek area was very much a pleasant surprise and I wish I’d spent the night up there.\nThe challenge also brings anglers close to other prime fishing spots. I fished thelower McCloud at the Nature Conservancy (I was unimpressed), Deer Creek outside of Chico, and had plans to fish Hat Creek, which is sort of on the way between Modoc County and Bogard Campground. I skipped it because of the impeding heat and by the time I was heading to Bogard I was ready to escape to the coast. Summer weather in California must be a consideration nowadays as none of the locations are at particularly high elevation (other than Dismal Creek), and the McCloud area especially was hot. I mentioned previously that the driving distances were substantial, even from the Bay Area, though it’s an entire half of the state with no traffic! Given those considerations, I would rank the HTC as more difficult than both Utah and Wyoming, but less difficult than Nevada (of course). In terms of enjoyment, I don’t think the scenery, isolation, and overall fishing quality can compete with Wyoming, but I think I preferred it to Utah. The driving was rough, but the variation in landscapes and habitats make up for it. Of course, all of this is subjective and will depend on which trout and locations each individual angler chooses to target.\nBack to Main Page"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Cache Valley, there are a number of options for catching the Bear River cutthroat as all local waters contain them. The Logan River is the largest river, and most obvious option. It’s a classic western free-stone trout stream, fishable from about early July through early November. In most places, the Logan is no more than knee deep, though there are some larger holes.\nBrown trout, and even some brook and rainbow trout also exist in the Logan, but the higher one goes in the canyon, the more likely it is one will catch a cutt. I mentally divide the river into lower, middle, and upper sections. I think of the lower section as from the mouth of the canyon where a small lake exists (locally referred to as “first dam”), to about Card Canyon, where there is a picnic area and turnout on the highway. From there, the middle section flows close to the road in most places in a tight canyon until the road climbs high above the river, referred to as the “dugway.” I’d never heard that term until I moved to Utah, and I’m still not sure what it means, but the road cuts across the face of a mountain and climbs until it once again meets the river. Temple Fork flows into the Logan shortly after the dugway. The upper part of the Logan is my favorite area to fish as the river is usually a little farther away from the road, and the fishing and scenery are good. However, this area probably receives the most pressure, though pressure on the Logan is light compared to most well-known western trout streams.\nI almost always fish above about Card Canyon (haven’t had much success lower), and the middle canyon section is mostly brown trout. My experience has been that after the dugway, in the upper section, there are more cutts than browns. The fishing is generally good on drys, especially in mid to late summer. Current regulations prohibit fishing from Red Banks Campground upstream to Idaho until the second weekend in July, though in a good water year the river will be still be blown out by then.\nNear the top of the canyon, the Logan River leaves the highway and flows almost due north-south from its headwaters in Idaho. This area is referred to as Franklin Basin, and there is a good forest road that parallels the river in this area with lots of dispersed camping, though it can get crowded. Beaver Creek flows into the Logan from the northeast at the start of Franklin Basin (moving upstream) and the highway flows alongside of it after leaving the mainstem Logan.\n Franklin Basin in the fall.\nThe Logan in Franklin Basin, Beaver Creek, and the Temple Fork are almost excluisvely cutts and have good fishing. I’ve had a lot of success in Franklin Basin, and in Spawn Creek, which meets Temple Fork a mile upstream of Temple Fork’s confluence with the Logan. A short hike up Spawn Creek offers nice beaver ponds, but I sometimes find the fish here can be surprisingly picky. I’ve never seen anyone else fishing Spawn Creek. I’ve had less success in Temple Fork, though I have caught fish in it. A lot of it is pretty brushy, and the more open parts don’t seem to hold a lot of fish, so I generally prefer Spawn Creek. Franklin Basin is also brushy in parts, especially farther upstream, but there are a lot of fish in there.\n Beaver ponds on Spawn Creek.\nLower down, Right Hand Fork flows into the Logan from the right hand side of the highway (moving upstream), and is all cutthroats. There is a good forest service road up some of Right Hand Fork, and a campground near the junction of two forest roads. There is also a trail that continues up Right Hand Fork after the road ends, following the creek for about 1.5 to 2 miles. Right Hand Fork seems to be a popular place to catch cutts. There are a few promotional videos online of media personalities and DWR employees talking about the slam and where to catch Bear River cutts, and it often looks like they are in Right Hand Fork.\nThe creek is separated from the mainstem Logan by a weir built a few years ago to protect it from encroaching browns. Right Hand Fork was then treated in 2013 to kill the browns and replanted with cutts sometime after. When I started fishing it in 2016, it was full of cutts and once I figured out how to deal with the brush, there were days when I caught dozens of fish. Since then, the fish seem to have become a little bit smarter so the fishing does not seem quite as good as it did in 2016 or 2017, although fish densities are very high. The one challenge with Right Hand Fork is that is a very small and brushy stream for much of its course near the road and trail, so it can be difficult to find a spot to cast. Rattlesnakes and moose are hazards.\n Right Hand Fork in the fall.\nHaving said all that about the Logan and its tributaries, I caught my Bear River in Curtis Creek, which flows through Hardware Ranch WMA into the Blacksmith Fork. The Blacksmith Fork is the second largest river in the valley, and the fishing is great in mid-summer. Because it’s smaller, it also clears from runoff a lot earlier than the Logan, making it fishable by mid-June in an average/good water year. Unfortunately, about 90% of the fish in Blacksmith Fork are browns. In fact, the DWR has a bonus limit of four additional brown trout, meaning you can catch and keep eight brown trout per day (as of 2023).\nThe ratio of cutts to browns in Curtis Creek is better than the mainstem Blacksmith Fork, probably something like 4 to 1 rather than 9 to 1. For my cutt slam, I caught the fish in mid-April as Curtis Creek drains a small area and is probably the first creek in the area to clear from runoff. Rock Creek, which flows into Blacksmith Fork a little lower, also has some cutts and clears relatively early as well. If one drives on the forest road through Hardware Ranch, the road eventually meets Rock Creek again higher up. It’s easy to park near the bridge and fish up the meadow, or move downstream and fish through some smaller meadows and into a small canyon. I’ve done this a few times and caught a lot of fish (mostly browns). The only drawback is that it’s about an hour drive from Logan each way so I don’t fish it that often, though neither does anyone else. In the spring and summer, there is a lot of dispersed camping in the area and people like to use the forest road through Hardware Ranch to see how fast they can drive their side-by-sides.\n A local enjoying the Blacksmith Fork river.\nThe other option for a Bear River cutt is Left Hand Fork of the Blacksmith, which flows past a number of campgrounds on Left Hand Fork road. This is one of my favorite places to fish early in the season (before Memorial Day) because it clears early and there are a lot of fish, but it’s almost all browns, in my experience. Unfortunately the quantity of dispersed camping and campgrounds means it is overrun by Memorial Day, and the area is an absolute nightmare during the height of summer. I’ve nearly experienced dog attacks and ATV crashes on Left Hand Fork Road. People seem to enjoy dropping their trailer or tent in a spot and reserving it for the entire summer. The forest service has made some efforts to better organize the dispersed camping and enforce the 14 day stay limit, though as far as I can tell, these efforts do not yet seem to be effective.\n Left Hand Fork of Blacksmith Fork.\nIf I were trying to catch the Bear River cutt, I’d probably start in the upper Logan or Franklin Basin, and failing that, go to Right Hand Fork. The fishing in the Logan and Franklin Basin is easier because they are bigger waters and there is more room to cast and wade. But, if those two didn’t work for whatever reason, Right Hand Fork is almost a sure thing if you can find a spot to make a cast without spooking the fish or getting tangled in the brush. Spawn Creek is also a good option, but it requires a 15 to 20 minute hike up to the beaver ponds, and there are brooks and browns in addition to cutthroats."

    "text": "Yellowstone Cutthroat–Raft River Mountains\nThis is widely accepted to be the most difficult fish to catch in the Utah slam. For most people, the Raft River Range is the farthest drive, the creeks are tiny, and there isn’t a ton of information on where to catch the fish. Some of the online promotional videos I’ve seen show people fishing water in private land or make only vague references to access points. I couldn’t figure out how to access any of the larger water like the Raft River, so I stuck to the most obvious option: Onemile Creek. There is a forest road that goes up the drainage, and my research seemed to suggest this was the best bet on public land.\nWhen I arrived to the spot where the forest road begins paralleling the creek, there was a jeep parked in a turnout: another guy and his wife also looking to catch the Yellowstone for their slam. From that turnout, they mentioned there is a relatively well-defined hole only a short walk up the creek where they’d brought a fish up. Onemile creek is very small and doesn’t even look like it can hold fish, but unlike a lot of creeks this size in Utah, it wasn’t that brushy. I started downstream of the hole they mentioned, fished up to it, and had absolutely no success. I hooked a shockingly large fish in that hole, got it to the surface and lost it. I made a few more casts, but it was clear the fish wasn’t coming back. I continued fishing up Onemile Creek for a while, and found no signs of life.\n Onemile creek is small.\nAt that point I wasn’t sure what to do. Downstream of the turnout where I first parked, there was another bad looking forest road that went across the creek and into another drainage. The creek seems to be referred to as Sawmill Canyon and I wasn’t sure it was even fishable, but I had read that it held Yellowstone cutts. I was skeptical I could get my truck up the road so I rode my mountain bike up it, over a short hill, and then up the canyon. I picked an arbitrary point on the forest road (it was barely a road at this point) to take the quick hike down to the creek. Sawmill Canyon was even smaller than Onemile and was very brushy.\nIt seemed futile as I started fishing but pretty quickly thought I had some fish hitting my dry fly that I let sink in some of the holes. I wasn’t entirely sure they were bites, but it did give me motivation to keep fishing. Within less than an hour, I caught a small Yellowstone cutt out of Sawmill. I caught a few more, all smaller than 6 inches. The fishing isn’t easy, but there seem to be more fish than in Onemile, and I think it gets less pressure. It wasn’t all that hard to access either as the walk/bike-in was maybe a mile or mile and a half.\n Sawmill Canyon is small and brushy.\nThere is a nice forest service campground nearby on Clear Creek, along with lots of dispersed camping. We were going to try and summit Bull Moutain the next day (highest point in the Raft River Range), but it started thunderstorming early in the morning so we left and drove back to Cache Valley. Clear Creek is quite fun to fish as there are a ton of fish that looked like cutts, but I think they are Inland Redband trout, as they are missing the orange slash under the jaw and have a pink lateral stripe. The DWR’s website does not mention Clear Creek as a possible water in which to find Yellowstones.\n Trout from Clear Creek. I think these are Inland Redband trout."

    "text": "Colorado River Cutthroat–Boulder Mountain\nLiving in Cache Valley is an advantage for reaching the Bear River and Yellowstone cutts (the Raft River is less than a two hour drive), but it is a decided disadvantage for the next fish I attempted to catch, the Colorado River cutt. In general, the Colorado River cutt is probably slightly easier to catch than the Yellowstone, but the geography of its native waters make it a long trip from Cache Valley. I had a hiking and sightseeing trip planned to the Capitol Reef area, so I did research on streams near the park entrance that might hold Colorado River cutts. When we visit Capitol Reef we like to stay at a nice forest service campground about a half hour from the park entrance. The DWR website lists Pine Creek as a nearby option so I started there with really no other plan if it didn’t work. Pine Creek flows off the northwest side of Boulder Mountain, but access is at a low enough elevation that isn’t too far of a drive from Bicknell.\n Pine Creek, near Bicknell, UT.\nI could find almost no information on the fishing aside from a single mention on the Utah Slam website so I had no idea what the road condition was, how big the creek was, or where to fish. The road turned out to be a good forest service road that I drove up until I found a spot to pull over and walk to the creek. Where I parked, the road isn’t alongside the creek so you can’t see the water until you get closer. Surprise, surprise, Pine Creek is tiny with what I would characterize as “moderate” brush (a running theme for Utah fly fishing). But, on walking up to the creek, I could see fish!\nDespite the look of the creek, it was relatively easy fishing; I walked upstream, found a brush-free spot, made a cast with a dry fly, and usually hooked a small fish. I caught a few quickly and had a nice time working my way upstream. I had plans to leave and fish the Fremont which is supposed to hold larger brown trout but as I was packing up after fishing Pine Creek, I stepped on my rod and broke it. I didn’t realize this until I drove to the Fremont, made a cast, and the top of my rod flew off. That was something like the third time I’d broken a rod, and there would be (and will be) more."

    "text": "Bonneville Cutthroat–Salt Lake City Area\nI left the Bonneville for last as I assumed it would be the easiest. I am in Salt Lake City often enough that I thought I’d just catch it quickly when in the area. Unfortunately, by the end of the summer, I just hadn’t gotten around to it. After an airport run, I thought I’d go to one the creeks that flows out of the Wasatch into the valley. The closest creek to the airport I could find was Mill Creek, which is right above the City and holds Bonnies according to the DWR website. I’d never been up there so I had no idea what the fishing was like.\nIt turns out Mill Creek Canyon is a very popular place to recreate on a Sunday afternoon. Not only was it crowded, you have to pay to visit in the canyon on the way out, which seems very odd. I fought traffic, found a place to park on the road, and walked down to the creek. This was late September and I was surprised to find a little snow on the ground because the sun doesn’t reach the creek in the fall or winter months. The shadows, combined with the warmish air temperature which caused the snow to melt and re-freeze, produced maximum slickness when wading.\n Mill Creek.\nAlso, unsurprisingly, Mill Creek is tiny and moderately brushy, and it looked just okay in terms of fishability. The low light in the canyon made it difficult to see my dry fly and for about the first hour, nothing happened. This was all very annoying because the Bonnie was supposed to be the easy one. I began thinking the DWR made a mistake and regretting my decision to fish Mill Creek. I finally hooked a fish, after a tough, cold wade. On the way out, I had to sit in traffic waiting to pay the fee. I completed the cutt slam in one year, but I feel comfortable saying that will be my last visit to Mill Canyon.\nI probably should have gone to a larger, nicer river to catch the Bonnie and most anglers will drive from Salt Lake City to the north slope of the Uintas to catch the fish there, or fish the Ogden or Weber. All are good options; Mill Creek has the advantage of being twenty minutes from SLC, but the experience is not what we think of in terms of western trout fishing."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nRelative to the other state slams I’ve done or attempted, Utah was the easiest, and is a good starter slam. It helps that it only requires catching four fish. The driving distances are shorter than Wyoming or California, and the fishing is pretty easy with the exception of the Yellowstone Cutt. The Bear River and Bonneville should, more or less, be gimmes, with the Colorado River somewhat tougher (though I got lucky Pine Creek was a good spot for me). Catching the Yellowstone out of Sawmill Canyon felt like a miracle, especially after having zero success in Onemile. There are other creeks listed on the DWR website that hold Yellowstones, but my impression is that they require significantly more effort to reach, or flow mostly through private land. I had a hard time figuring out access points. If I were going back, I would give myself some backup options if neither Onemile nor Sawmill worked. The most obvious seems to be Johnson Creek, which I’ve read recently is a good option, and there have been reports of anglers catching large Yellowstones from that water. It is farther from Clear Creek Campground however, and I don’t know what access is like.\nOne additional note on Utah’s slam. Unlike every other state slam, completing the Utah slam is not free; it requires paying a fee of $20. The money is used to fund conservation projects for fish, and Utah DNR trumpets the projects they’ve completed with the money. I have mixed feelings about charging. I worry the fee will exclude or dissuade people who would otherwise complete the challenge, but raising money for conservation projects is undoubtedly beneficial. If we’re honest about the socio-economic status of most people who are fly fishing, I doubt the $20 is making much of a difference in whether someone decides to complete the slam. On balance then, it seems like a good idea, and other states should probably implement a similar fee.\nBack to Main Page"

    "title": "Wyoming Slam: A Guide to Catching Wyoming’s Native Fish Species",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Unlike the Utah Slam, which I did over the course of a summer, I attempted the Wyoming Slam over the course of a few days. It didn’t work, and I had to make a second trip to Wyoming to complete the slam, but because I don’t live in Wyoming, I initially wanted to minimize driving back-and-forth. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about this approach. I definitely felt rushed the whole trip, feeling like I was doing more driving than fishing. On the other hand, I knocked out three of the four fish I needed in about five days, including the fish farthest from my house that I wanted to avoid having to make a second round trip to catch. When I had a free weekend near the end of summer, I drove back to Wyoming to target one fish, and luckily it was one of the closest to my house. I wouldn’t want to complete a challenge over this short of a timespan again, but for most of us who don’t live in western Wyoming and have jobs and other responsibilities, trying to complete the slam in a week or so is the most viable option.\nDespite the long driving distances, I thought Wyoming would be easier than the Utah slam; the state has more options for each fish, bigger water (less brush), and at the time, had more resources online to help plan a fishing trip. Wyoming has a program called “Instream Flow” that provides helpful information on lots of different rivers and creeks, and a separate challenge called “XStream Angler” in which you receive a hat if you a take a picture of yourself near three qualifying rivers or creeks. This is an easy thing to complete when you do your slam as most waters fished in the slam are also considered “instream flow” rivers. When I did the slam a few years ago, they required pictures near seven rivers, but perhaps that was too demanding for most people.\nMy driving plan was somewhat convoluted, and in retrospect, I did not do this correctly. Once I’d caught the Bonneville, I planned to go up a road that follows the Smiths Fork north, take that up and over to the Tri-Basin divide, fish for the Colorado River Cutthroat in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to fish for Snake River cutthroat. This proved to be unsuccessful because the road up Smiths Fork connecting with the Tri-Basin divide slowly deteriorated as we drove up it. Eventually, we came to a spot where the road turned into a giant mud puddle and though it looked like I might be able to get my truck through it, I decided discretion was the better part of valor and turned around. I once got stuck in mud on a dirt road in Kansas, and that experience scarred me so deeply I have become extremely risk averse on muddy roads. Unfortunately, this meant going all the way back out to Cokeville and driving around the southern end of the Wyoming Range. It also changed the creeks I would fish, which ended up having significant consequences.\n\n\nBonneville Cutts are found in rivers that flow into the Great Basin. Utah further separates species into Bear River and Bonneville, while Wyoming makes no such distinct. I don’t know what the scientific case is for calling the Bear River and Bonneville separate species, and I suspect Utah does it because they can’t have a fish slam with only three species. Regardless, Hobble Creek flows into the Bear River via the Smiths Fork from the Wyoming Range outside of Cokeville, Wyoming. It’s only about an hour and a half from my home in Cache Valley, Utah so this was the first place I started. I’ve now done quite a bit of hiking, camping, and fishing in the Wyoming Range and adjacent Salt River Range, both of which are incredibly underrated.\nMy first stop, Hobble Creek is reached by a long drive on relatively good forest roads up until the last mile or so where there is a creek crossing. High clearance vehicles without four-wheel drive should have no problem in mid-Summer, but I wouldn’t take a sedan across the creek. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a spot for dispersed camping at the crossing that I could see, so it’s important to cross and get to the campground farther down the road. At the campground is also a day-use parking lot for Lake Alice, which is about a two mile hike. It makes for a nice sidetrip and the lake has an interesting geological history. This area is used quite a bit by locals visiting the lake on daytrips, but there was only one other site taken in the campground. I think the creek receives a moderate amount of pressure farther downstream as I’ve seen a few people fishing it the times I’ve been up there.\n Into a big brown on Hobble Creek.\nAlice Creek, which flows out of Lake Alice, comes into Hobble right at the campground, and the flow is greater after their confluence. When you first enter Hobble Creek canyon on the forest road, before the campground, Coantag Creek joins up with Hobble Creek and also significantly increases the flow into Hobble. I think most people fish from this point downstream because it’s a bigger creek so they assume it holds bigger fish, and it’s the closest road access for people who drive up for the day.\nI’ve only fished upstream from Coantag Creek, on Hobble Creek up to Alice Creek, then above Alice Creek. Besides the increased pressure, the problem with fishing downstream of Coantag Creek is that it if you stay at the campground, you either need to walk or drive downstream approximately a mile or two to get back to this water. That didn’t make much sense to me so I just walked down the road a few hundred yards to get downstream of the campground then fished back up to it. I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I can promise there are very large fish, both cutts and browns, upstream of Coantag Creek near the campground.\nWhen I was fishing for the slam, it was my first time fishing Hobble. On the Logan, my “home river,” there is a fish in every soft spot on the river, almost behind every rock. Because that was what I was used to, and I didn’t have a lot of experience fishing other rivers, I expected to have higher catch rates in Hobble Creek. In fact, when we arrived at the campground in the late afternoon, I walked upstream of the campground and found a nice hole with an undercut bank. Almost immediately, I hooked into a large fish that ended up being a brown. I wasn’t expecting brown trout in Hobble Creek as I thought it was all cutthroat, so though it was a 15 inch plus fish, it didn’t count for the slam. That first fish fooled me because I thought the fishing was going to be easy but I had a more difficult time catching a cutthroat the next morning.\nI wasted a lot of time fishing spots that in retrospect weren’t likely to hold fish. Eventually, I caught exactly one cutthroat and a few additional browns, and had my first fish of the Wyoming slam. Hobble Creek has since become one of my favorite fishing and camping spots, and I’ve subsequently caught very large (nearly 20 inch) cutthroats in the creek, though there are perhaps not as many fish as I would expect given how good the water looks.\nOn that first trip, the large brown I caught made for a delicious dinner. I usually practice catch and release, and I would never keep a cutthroat in a native drainage, but I view browns in these drainages as an invasive species so I sometimes eat them.\n Catch and cook.\n\n\n\nAs I described above, an attempt to take the road which parallels the Smiths Fork over to Tri-Basin Divide didn’t work as the road was impassable. I was worried this was going to happen and it added hours of driving. Smiths Fork above Cokeville, near the turnoff to the road to Hobble Creek, is a large-ish river that is supposed to have very good fishing. However, access is a bit of a problem as most of the river is private, and there is nowhere to camp nearby. This could be an option for the Bonneville if one wanted to stay in a hotel near Cokeville, though I believe the Smiths Fork also has browns in it. I chose Hobble Creek because it offered convenient camping. I later fished the Smiths Fork up much higher, closer to the Tri-Basin divide, which has much better forest road access (the road I was attempting to connect to) and flows through public land. There is abundant and excellent dispersed camping in this area, but surprisingly, the fishing wasn’t very good for me over two nights of camping. I caught a few fish here and there but in general I really struggled. I’ve only fished it that once so I’m not sure if that was bad technique on my part or if the fishing really isn’t that great.\nThe vast majority of people attempting the slam center their efforts on Tri-Basin divide. One can catch the Bonneville in upper Smiths Fork, drive a very short way to catch the Colorado River in LaBarge Creek, then go down Greys River Road to catch the Snake River. All three of these fish exist within maybe a five mile radius. Because I couldn’t connect up to Tri-Basin, I drove around the southern end of the Wyoming Range to fish the creeks coming off the east side of the range, then connected over to the Greys on forest roads via McDougal Gap. Again, literally every Wyoming Cutt Slam report online says to fish LaBarge Creek, but I didn’t want to drive up LaBarge Creek road, then down Greys River road as I thought that would add significant time, and there aren’t any campgrounds on LaBarge Creek or in the Tri-Basin area. Because the Wyoming Fish and Game lists a number of creeks on the east side of the Wyoming Range that hold cutts, I thought I would just fish these. The night after leaving Hobble, we camped at Sacajawea Campground which is located on Middle Piney Creek.\n Middle Piney creek near Sacajawea Campground. Small, but should have given more effort. The smoke started moving in.\nSacajawea is another amazing, nearly deserted forest service campground in Wyoming that should be crowded. Unfortunately, Middle Piney Creek was tiny and my brief efforts to fish on evening arrival didn’t yield anything. Here is where feeling time pressured got to me. Instead of giving Middle Piney a real chance, the next day we decided to begin heading to Greys River Road and fish along the way as the drive over to the Greys would cross a number of creeks. Before I complain about the fishing, I will say the scenery on this drive is spectacular.\nThe first stop was North Piney Creek. The fishing was slow but I did manage to catch a brook trout, which was not helpful. The second stop was North Cottonwood Creek, which parallels the forest road which goes over McDougal Gap. After about an hour of fishing unsuccessfully, I finally caught a small brook trout. This was very frustrating, and out of ideas, I gave up and we drove over McDougal Gap to the Greys River.\n North Piney Creek. Looks good, caught nothing but a few brooks.\n Same story on North Cottonwood.\n Driving between basins on east side of Wyoming Range.\n\n\n\nThe Greys River forms in the Tri-Basin divide and Greys River Road runs its entire length, from there to Alpine, WY where the Greys meets the Snake in Palisades Resevoir. The road is well maintained and well traveled, and while this area isn’t exactly deserted, its not so crowded as to be unpleasant. The scenery is spectacular and the fishing is supposed to be very good as well. We stayed in Forest Park Campground which is just upriver from where the forest road over McDougal Gap meets Greys River Road. Forest Park was also mostly empty, though a lot of people prefer to disperse camp along the Greys River.\n Over McDougal Gap into Greys River drainage, forest road at bottom left. It had been smoky all day.\nI eventually caught my Snake River cutt in the Greys. It was not spectacular fishing in terms of catch rate or size, but the surroundings made up for much of that. It was very hot when I was there, and nothing really started happening until late in the afternoon. I’d already been fishing for a few hours so I caught maybe three or four medium size cutts and called it. We had a very long drive planned the next day, and I was frustrated after my lack of success fishing for the Colorado River cutt.\nOddly, I’ve never fished the Greys again, despite passing by it a number of times. There isn’t a good reason for that, other than I’ve never really gotten around to it. I would like to drive its entire length from Alpine to Tri-Basin divide. Years later, for my Western Native Trout Challenge, I fished the very top of LaBarge Creek and caught a Colorado River cutt, but didn’t make it down to the Greys. I’d like to determine whether my slow evenings on both the Smiths Fork and Greys River were aberrations or if the fishing is not as good as reports suggest. One other note on Greys River road: when leaving Greys River Road and entering Alpine, WY, a stop at Melvin Brewery is mandatory.\n\n\n\nWas the drive from Alpine, though Jackson, Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, out to Cody, and to the Greybull River a frustrating slog through bumper-to-bumper traffic? Yes, and I won’t relive it by elaborating further. I’ve now driven through Yellowstone twice in the summer, and I’m sorry to say it’s just awful.\nOutside of Cody, and closer to Meeteetse, WY, there are quite a few possibilities for the Yellowstone cutthroat. Both the Greybull and Wood River are supposed to have fantastic fishing, and I chose the Greybull because of the forest service campground on the river and because Jack Creek flows into the Greybull at the campground; if the mainstem didn’t work, I would have a backup.\n Sunset over Jack Creek Campground.\nThe road from Meeteetse to Jack Creek Campground, on the Greybull, is long and rough, but as per usual, there was not a single other campsite taken. This is incredible to me given how close it is to the hordes nearby in Yellowstone. The scenery is incredible, the river looks like a classic, western blue-ribbon trout stream, and the grizzly bears are, apparently, plentiful. Jack Creek campground is a place I wanted to stay for a week, and fortunately, the fishing lived up to its promise.\nThis was by far, the most enjoyable experience of the whole trip. The evening we arrived, I fished the river almost behind my campsite and immediately caught a few nice cutthroat. There were fish rising everywhere, and it’s clear the river doesn’t see a lot of pressure. The next morning I fished again, and again caught quite a few fish. The Greybull is extremely slick to wade, and I kept an eye out for grizzlies, but the fishing was amazing. My catch rate was high, the average fish size was probably about 12 inches, with a few pushing 15. These fishing experiences are so enjoyable, but they make for a short story: arrived, got a nice campsite, and caught a lot of fish in beautiful scenery.\n Greybull River in the morning.\n\n\n\nI went back to the eastern slope of the Wyoming Range in mid-September, after my summer trip. And, just like my summer trip, I made the mistake of not going to LaBarge Creek. The reason for this is that we wanted to do a backpacking trip, and there is no backpacking along LaBarge Creek, only driving. Instead, I decided we would hike up North Piney Creek, and I assumed, like the Utah rivers I’m familiar with, that increasing elevation would increase the cutthroat to non-cutthroat ratio.\n The east slope of the Wyoming Range in fall.\nWe only had a weekend, and work delays meant we left too late on Friday. We arrived at the North Piney Creek trailhead too late in the day to get very far up the river, though I met a guy coming down the trail who had fished. He assured me he caught some cutthroats, though also gave me an ominious warning about the start of hunting season. It turned out that after hiking up the trail about two miles, we hiked directly into hunters who parked at a higher trailhead reachable on a quad or side-by-side. In other words, by going up the drainage away from the main road, we actually hiked into the crowds. We inadvertently setup camp nearly in the dark very close to a staging area. This meant we woke up at about five a.m. to the sound of quads and hunters talking. Not a great camping experience!\nThe night we arrived, I managed to fish for a few minutes before dark and I caught a lot of fish. Unfortunately, they were all five inch brook trout. It’s my understanding that back East a lot of people pursue brookies and view them with reverance, but I absolutely loathe them. They don’t belong in the West, they never get very big in western rivers, and there always seem to be a million of them when trying to catch a native fish.\nThe next morning we hiked farther up North Piney Creek, but the water got very small very quickly, and I didn’t have much fishing success. The number of hunters and off-road vehicles was a legitimate issue too as it was a total zoo in the area. I also hunt and have no moral objection to it, though I get annoyed with the use of gas-powered vehicles to cover ground in the backcountry. We decided to hike out and try our luck elsewhere. Hilariously, at the trailhead off the main forest road, and below where all the hunters drove onto the trail, there was a bull elk bugling like crazy from some pine trees.\nWe drove from North Piney to North Cottonwood. As in the summer, my plan was to use the road along North Cottonwood to connect over to Greys River Road, then out to Alpine, and back to Cache Valley. I was also hoping that because the creek was right along a road there would be fewer hunters. That was a poor assumption. Nearly every plausible dispersed campsite was taken and we were forced to camp in what was essentially a turnout along the road. The good news is that I had all day to catch at least one cutthroat from North Cottonwood Creek, which the Wyoming Game and Fish says is “one of the state’s finest fly-fishing streams,” and one in which Colorado River cutthroat are “common.”\nIt is definitely full of brook trout. For hours I caught dozens of them. As usual, the average size was about eight inches and it’s just not very satisfying fishing. It was getting dark and I was getting frustrated. I began to suspect that the cutthroat were deeper in the water column but I really wanted to use a dry fly to catch one. But, every cast on top of the water just brought up brooks. This is an experience I’ve had in a number of places with small, aggressive fish attacking the surface, but larger fish remaining deeper. Eventually, I think I just got lucky. I cast to an undercut bank and my dry fly got sucked under the surface, maybe only a foot, if that. I hooked a fish and it immediately looked different. I had caught my Colorado River cutt.\nWere I to do this experience today, I would pretty quickly switch to a dry-dropper, or even just a pure nymph setup. At the time, I didn’t really use nymphs or dropper setups effectively, and was really stuck on trying to fish exclusively with drys. I’ve also gotten better at using a dry similar to a wet fly by allowing it to sink. This is most effective on very small creeks by allowing the dry to float through the whitewater then sink into a hole. I’ve even begun tying my version of a wet fly modeled after an Adams, but without any hackle to allow it to better sink. When fishing it, I don’t add any floatant and after it soaks, the fly will start to sink a little, especially when it encounters whitewater or riffles. This can be very effective at getting the fly just deep enough to entice a trout sitting at the bottom of a hole on a small creek. The trout still needs to move up, so it isn’t the same as nymphing where one attempts to get the fly all the way down to the fish, but I think it simulates a floating bug that may have just gotten sucked underneath the current a bit. North Cottonwood may be slightly too big of water to do this effectively, but I could imagine allowing a fly to sink just six inches or so under an undercut bank. In fact, this is almost exactly how I caught my cutt, though it wasn’t purposeful when I did it on North Cottonwood. Does this count as dry fly fishing? Not really, but I can say I caught all my Wyoming fish, as with all my Utah fish, on dry flies, even if they were not always floating.\n Over McDougal Gap in September. Compare this picture without smoke to the one above.\n\n\n\nPerhaps part of the reason why the Greybull was so enjoyable is that once I caught my fish the evening I arrived, the pressure was off. It was the last stop before I went home, and I had caught three of the four. Again, the lesson (for me, anyway) seems to be not to rush things. I wish I could have stayed longer at each spot and really learned the river or creek. As I mentioned, I’ve fished Hobble Creek a few times now, and I’ve had some amazing experiences on that water because I’ve been able to explore it more and understand the fish in the creek better. When fishing for an evening or morning on the way to the next spot, one doesn’t get to unlock the fishing on a particular water at all.\nOn the other hand, most of us have jobs, families, regular lives to live, and we can’t spend three or four days in one spot if we’re trying to finish the slam. Perhaps two full nights at each spot is optimal, but that means eight nights, not including driving days. And, if catching a particular species isn’t successful, then one has to decide pretty quickly whether they are going to move on, or burn all their time working on one fish.\nThe Wyoming slam was the first state slam established and remains the most famous for a reason. The driving was a hassle, especially through Yellowstone at the height of summer. I had done it a few years before and promised myself never again, then I did it again. This time, I really won’t do it again. But, Western Wyoming is an amazing place and there is so much to do and see besides Teton and Yellowstone. My trip didn’t even touch the Bighorns or Wind River range. I would love to go back to the Meeteetse area and fish the Greybull again, but also the Wood and the smaller creeks in that area. It was rumored that Fenn’s Treasure was hidden in the Wood River drainage, though recent reports suggest it was in Yellowstone National Park, to the west of the Shoshone National Forest, where most of the Greybull and Wood River drainages are located.\nPerhaps because I live in Utah, the Wyoming slam felt bigger, more interesting, and more classically “western.” There weren’t any tiny, brushy creeks on this trip, and though I didn’t go to any of the really famous Wyoming waters, the fishing was mostly very good. The rivers are big, but not too big, the pressure is light, the campgrounds are quiet, and the scenery is excellent.\nIn some ways the Wyoming Cutt Slam is easier than the Utah version because the fishing is a little more straightforward, with the exception of the Colorado River Cutt. I think LaBarge Creek is the obvious place to go now, though I’ve read reports online that it can sometimes be difficult fishing. I fished it in the Tri-Basin Divide once, after I’d completed my slam, and I caught some small cutts without too much difficulty.\nThe Bonneville could also be a little tricky if the Smiths Fork or Hobble Creek don’t work, and in both of those you’ll have to fight through the browns, and possibly rainbows or brooks. I know nothing about the other creeks listed on the Fish and Game’s website, but when researching this trip, they didn’t seem like good options for one reason or another.\nThe logistics in Wyoming are more difficult than Utah however, and if for some reason you struck out on a particular river and had to come back, it’s likely going to be a lot of travel time. I also got relatively lucky with the weather, with the only real challenge coming on the Greys where it was very hot. The air quality in the Wyoming Range was not great due to smoke, but fly fishing is not aerobic so it wasn’t a big deal other than obscuring some of the scenery. Summers in the West are increasingly unpredictable and very hot weather, fires, smoke, or heavy rain can derail plans. For these reasons, I think Utah is still probably the easier first cutt slam to attempt, but it’s close between the two.\nBack to Main Page"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In early 2023, I went with my family to Tequila, Mexico for tequila tasting and sightseeing. I did a lot of research prior to going, mostly on Reddit and other individual blogs, and found they were of some help. I want to detail my experience so others can plan their trip. I can summarize my overall impression by saying, if you’re thinking about doing this, you should; it’s a great trip.\n\n\nWe flew from Tijuana, Mexico to Guadalajara. My family lives in Southern California and it’s much cheaper to cross into Mexico and fly one of the Mexican domestic carriers than it is to fly from the U.S. For most people, this won’t be possible, but most major U.S. airlines fly to Guadalajara. The Guadalajara airport is nice and fairly large, and it was an easy trip from the airport into the city by taxi for about $20. We bought the taxi ride from a stand inside the airport, as you should always do in Mexico, rather than hailing a taxi from the curb. A few sources online suggested that Uber was not available at the Guadalajara airport, but when I signed on, there were a number of cars available. We used the taxi because the stand was right in the baggage claim area and it just seemed easier.\nWe were concerned about safety before we left, especially because a few days before the Mexican Government arrested the son of El Chapo, and armed conflict broke out between the cartel and the government in Sinaloa, especially in the city of Culiacan. That city is more than 400 miles from Guadalajara, and we never felt unsafe whatsoever during the day. At night we were advised not to walk around our neighborhood, Colonia Americana, so we didn’t venture farther than about four blocks from the hotel in the evening. One night we had dinner at Alcalde, which was pricey but fantastic, and took an Uber there and back even though it was only about one mile each way, within walking distance for us.\nGuadalajara is an interesting and lively city, and it is worth staying a night or two there before heading to Tequila. We stayed three nights and that was probably one night too many. We had plans to see a rodeo, but all sporting events and some other public activities were canceled because of the violence. This was a one-off, unusual event, and not something that happens regularly. All the standard attractions in Guadalajara listed on other travel guides are worth visiting, so I won’t go into details about those here.\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, the vast majority of American tourists end up day-tripping from Guadalajara to Tequila. I think this is a mistake, as I really liked spending two nights in the town itself. The famous Jose Cuervo Tequila Train only runs on weekends, so we weren’t able to do that. From what I could gather, the train takes people into the town, lets them visit the Cuervo factory, walk around town, then takes them back to Guadalajara. I much preferred having some time to spend in the town itself.\nWe took an Uber from near the center of Guadalajara to Tequila. It took about an hour and fifteen minutes, and cost us $60. Getting back from Tequila to Guadalajara is trickier because there are not a lot of Ubers in Tequila. We ended up hiring a driver through our guide, which cost us $100. There are two other options: hire a taxi in Tequila to Guadalajara, if possible. There are taxis in town, but I’m not sure they’d be willing to drive all the way back or how much it would cost. The other option is the bus which goes from the Tequila bus station, close to the main tourist part of town, and stops at various stations in Guadalajara. The bus leaves every half hour or so all day, and costs only about $10 per person. This was our plan if we were unable to hire a car. The drawback of the bus is that it is slower than a car, and it ends at the central bus station from which you’d have to take an Uber or taxi to your hotel. Also be forewarned: there is often heavy traffic leaving and returning to Guadalajara.\n\n\n\n The town of Tequila, near the main square.\nThe town of Tequila is small and walkable, and felt completely safe. There seemed to be a lot of Mexican tourists drinking and taking tours in buses shaped like tequila barrels, but not many Americans. While there aren’t a ton of sights in the town per se, it’s just a nice place to walk around, hang out, and kill some time. There are distilleries/factories near the downtown area, and a ton of bars and shops; it’s kind of like a tamer version of walking the Vegas strip. If you want to go from shop to shop and bar to bar tasting tequila on the street, you’re in luck. Cantarito is the mixed drink of the moment, and seems to be quite popular among the locals and tourists. It’s made with tequila, citrus juice, and Squirt, and served in a clay cup. I prefer my tequila neat so tasting one cantarito was enough for me.\n “House” tequila in plastic jugs piling up in a bar.\nThere are a few tequila distilleries/factories in town, and we chose the Sauza tour for no other reason than it came recommended on Reddit. Orendain, Cuervo, and potentially others are possibilities. And again, each bar seems to have its own “house” tequila that you can taste. The Sauza tour was fine and we got free tequila drinks at the end. We made a reservation but some of them (maybe Orendain?) don’t require reservations. Cuervo is obviously the biggest operation and has a small village in Tequila that multiple people referred to as similar to Disneyland.\n Mural at Sauza celebrating Tequila.\n\n\n\nMy image of doing a “tasting” comes from wine tasting in California. I wanted to get outside of town, see the fields, and visit some smaller distilleries. It turns out, this isn’t really possible. The model is not the same as it is for American wineries. First, every distillery one is able to visit has an attached tour with a tasting, and in fact, you’re paying for the tour. Of course, after the first tour or two, you probably don’t need to do another one. But, the model in Mexico seems to be that the tasting is secondary to the tour. It’s as if when wine tasting in Santa Barbara, each winery had a tour of its production facilities then at the end allowed you to taste some of its wine. By the time we got to our last distillery, Tres Mujeres, we skipped the tour and went straight to the tasting. This may not be possible at all of the distilleries, however. We tried this at Cascahuin, our third distillery, and the employees basically insisted we take the tour. To be fair, every distillery has a slightly different production process, and the tour at Cascahuin was different enough from our previous tours that we still enjoyed it.\nThe distilleries themselves are not scattered around the countryside, like most wineries, but are instead production facilities in the towns or on highways near Tequila. The agave is shipped in from the fields to the facility, not made onsite like in classic American vineyard and winery. As a result, you’re basically driving into small towns to get to a storefront with a factory behind it. This model is fine, it’s just not how I conceive of “going tasting”.\nJust like with wineries, there was variation in the price and quantity of tequila you are able to drink, and this also likely varies with your guide. We hired a guide to pick us up in Tequila, drive us to three distilleries, and drive us back to our AirBnb in Tequila, with a lunch stop along the way. This is probably the way to do it, and there are a ton of guide services listed online. They are all relatively expensive however, and I’m not sure it is possible to book something cheaper, for Americans anyway. Most of the guide services I saw only cost roughly $120 per person, though you can reduce individual costs with more people. I liked our guide a lot so please contact me for his information.\n The piñas and ovens at Cascahuin.\nWe visited Cava del Oro, Cascahuin, and Tres Mujeres. Cascahuin seemed like the smallest and most artisanal of the three, but the other members of my group liked the tequila from Cava del Oro the best. They also had the most generous tasting experience, offering basically unlimited tastes of something like five tequilas and two mezcals. Tres Mujeres was a bit disappointing in that they only had two tequilas to taste. It was also obviously the biggest operation we visited, and while they had Instagram-ready views of the tequila fields and the cellars, it felt the most corporate and touristy of the three.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to do tequila tasting outside the town without a guide? I don’t think so, for the following reasons. If you want to get out of the town of Tequila, you need someone to drive you. There are no Ubers available in Tequila, though there are a lot of taxis. You could hire a taxi to drive you to one distillery, but then how would you get from that distillery to another distillery or back to Tequila? I suppose you could pay the taxi to wait, but at that point you’ve basically just hired a guide. Further, it’s clear the distilleries have relationships with guides. Some of them require reservations, which your guide should make for you, and others seemed to have bureaucratic requirements that seemed to require a guide to do the tour and tasting. For example, at two of the three distilleries we went to, our guide gave us the tour and tasting, not an employee of the distillery. If you don’t have a guide, I’m not sure they will even allow you to do a tour and tasting. Each of the tours and tastings cost a nominal fee, something like $10 per person, or less.\nWe specifically asked our guide to take us to smaller, lesser-known tequila distilleries. In retrospect, it’s not clear there is any such thing. It is exceedingly difficult to determine which distilleries are open to the public using the internet. And, the same distilleries make a lot of different brands of tequila so even if you think you’re going to the distillery for a particular small-batch tequila, it’s likely it’s made by a bigger manufacturer. It seems that there are something like six or seven distilleries everyone goes to, and many of the smaller operations may not even be open for tasting.\nWe bought at least one bottle from each of the distilleries. Interestingly, every tequila or mezcal we tasted or saw for sale is available from stores in the U.S., based on google searches of the brand. This was surprising to me, but it actually makes sense–fancy tequila is mostly being sold in the U.S., not in Mexico. Though it is disappointing that we weren’t able to find an underground, unheard of tequila brand, the bottles from the distillery were anywhere from 30% to 50% cheaper than they are in U.S. stores.\nAs we were driving through the towns, distilleries were going up everywhere. It’s clear the region expects an influx of tourists in the next few years, and everyone is trying to cash in. Get to Tequila soon before it is overrun with American tourists.\n Tres Mujeres had the only views of blue agave fields from a distillery.\n\n\n\nThe rules about bringing liquor back into the U.S. are complicated, apparently, and we got stopped at the border after trying to declare our nine bottles. Keep in mind, we took the bridge from the Tijuana airport into San Diego, and the rules are different from those driving across or flying into the U.S. Ultimately, the customs agent told us not to do it again and let us through with our tequila. I wish I could offer advice on how much you’re allowed to bring back, but I am completely confused about what’s allowed and what’s not. I spoke to a friend later who tried to bring back whiskey from Canada and was also subjected to confusing rules. He was told at the border that it depends on the agent’s discretion. I guess it’s too much to ask the U.S. Government to develop and post clear guidelines about bringing alcohol back through various crossings.\n\n\n\n\nThree nights in Guadalajara\n\nStayed at Rame Hotel Boutique\n\nTwo nights in Tequila\n\nStayed at AirBnb\n\nOne night in Tlaquepaque, a suburb of Guadalajara\n\nStayed at La Villa del Ensueno\n\nDistilleries visited\n\nCasa Sauza, in downtown Tequila\nCava del Oro, outside Tequila\nCascahuin, in Arenal outside Tequila\nTres Mujeres, outside Tequila\n\n\nAs I noted above, if one wanted to do this trip in fewer nights, one could do one or two nights in Guadalajara on the front end, two nights in Tequila, then straight back to the airport, or one night back in Guadalajara. I think two nights in Tequila is optimal because that gives you one day to arrive, walk around town and drink tequila, then another day to visit distilleries outside of town, leaving the next day. Everyone in my groups speaks decent Spanish, and we did one tour in Spanish (at Sauza), but it’s easy to find English-speaking guides. Almost everyone we encountered in the service industry in both Tequila and Guadalajara spoke some English.\nBack to Main Page"

    "text": "Logistics for Hiking Mt. Tarn and Faro San Isidro\nYou’ll need a car to reach the parking lot, which is about an hour down the coast (south) from Punta Arenas. We had pre-booked a rental car from the airport, and took a taxi back to the airport to pick up the car. Though there are rental car options in town, they were sold-out by the time we booked. I suspect it is possible to hitchhike to the trailhead parking lot as there was a decent number of cars headed down there, but it might be tough to find a ride back to town. There is no public transportation as far as I know.\nThe drive down the coast is scenic, with views of the Magellan Straight and the low inland hills. The road turns into dirt a few miles from the parking lot, but it’s in good condition and four-wheel drive was not necessary. The parking lot is obvious as the road dead-ends and there are signs indicating the end of the road and the cape. There will likely be other cars parked here as well. Park your car here and start walking down the road.\n The sign at the end of the road indicating that San Isidro is the most southern lighthouse in the Americas. The last sign with stickers says, “Fin de Camino.”\n\nReaching the Summit of Mt. Tarn: What to Expect\nIt isn’t immediately obvious where the trail to Mt. Tarn is, but after walking a short distance down the road paralleling the ocean (maybe .25 miles), there will be a sign and trail on the right with some stairs leading away from the ocean into the forest. This is the start of the Mt. Tarn hike. Caltopo says it’s about 3.14 miles and 2,600 feet to the top, which is consistent with our experience. It sounds steep, but it really wasn’t as bad as it seems on paper.\nThe trail climbs very steeply through the forest before emerging onto a flat-ish plateau a bit above the ocean. There are signs and poles marking the trail, but there are also a lot of side trails made from hikers avoiding mud. The mud is definitely a thing on this hike as it very bad and exists nearly the entire way up. In fact, it gets worse the higher you climb. So though it’s easy to not know if you are on the official trail, it’s easy to figure out where you should be going. The signs along the trail also tell you the distance you’ve come and where the next sign is, so I consider it almost impossible to get lost.\n These signs exist every so often on the way up to Mt. Tarn, making it easy to follow the route.\nAfter briefly emerging on the plateau, the trail dips into a thick forest. The trail is really destroyed here, and there is some deadfall which makes the going slow. This section is short however, and the trail once again emerges from the trees. From here it continues uphill, cuts across flat bogs, goes uphill more, and cuts across a boggy/lagoon area. The mud is so, so bad. The good news is that Mt. Tarn is obviously getting much closer and one can begin to see the hike up the slopes of the mountain.\n The mud and boggy-ness is really bad. Bring extra shoes to change into for the return drive to Arenas.\n Mt. Tarn as seen from the trail. The brown streak across the face looks like a trail but is not.\nThe last section up the slopes of Mt. Tarn is steep, but at least it isn’t muddy (mostly). The real problem for us here was the wind. No surprise, it was blowing hard and made things just spicy enough to be interesting. There isn’t any exposure but walking uphill directly into the wind with little ice pellets pelting down was uncomfortable. I don’t know how hard the wind was blowing, maybe 40 or 50 miles per hour?\nWe didn’t actually make it to the summit, but instead reached the shoulder of Mt. Tarn. It was simply too windy to continue, especially once we reached the ridge of the mountain. The views here are very good, and it’s cool being on a mountain that Darwin supposedly climbed when the Beagle visited the area.\n View looking north from the shoulder of Mt. Tarn below the summit.\n View looking south toward the Straight. San Isidro lighthouse at bottom.\n\n\nExploring the Faro San Isidro Lighthouse Trail\nI can make this short and sweet. From Mt. Tarn, return to the road the same way. From the road, begin walking south away from the parking lot. This is almost entirely a beach walk which means walking through sand. It’s about 2.5 miles (2.87 according to Caltopo), which makes the roundtrip about 5.74. Add that to the 6.28 miles to the top of Mt. Tarn and back, and it’s a 12 mile day that is not that easy given the elevation gain, the mud, and the sand.\nThe lighthouse is interesting. It’s not open, but you can walk around the grounds and get some good views of the Straight and the mountains to the northwest. All in all, this is a good warmup hike for the O and a good way to spend a day in the Punta Arenas area.\n Approaching the lighthouse.\nBack to O Hike Overview"
